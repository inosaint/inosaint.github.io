'Meteorites: Earth Impact'
--------------------------

*'Meteorites: Earth Impact'* is an attempt to visualize meteorites that have impacted earth in the past. The Meteoritical Society has a massive database of all the recorded meteorites that have collided with Earth dating as far back as 2500 BCE, providing the most comprehensive public picture of known meteorite collisions. This visualization is my first attempt at interactive visualization and was built for the 'Visualizing Meteorites' contest held by Visualizing.org in the month of May 2013.
