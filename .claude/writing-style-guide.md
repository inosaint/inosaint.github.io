# Kenneth D'souza Writing Style Guide

## Voice & Tone

**Core Characteristics:**
- **Conversational yet professional** - Write like you're explaining to a colleague over coffee, not presenting to a board
- **Honest and self-aware** - Acknowledge failures, limitations, and learning moments
- **Experience-driven** - Ground insights in real stories, not abstract theory
- **Critically thoughtful** - Have strong opinions, but show the reasoning behind them

**Examples from your writing:**
- ✅ "I got to be honest with you — some Squads may not work out."
- ✅ "That was not how we wanted our products to be used. This was not empowerment — and it certainly wasn't scalable."
- ✅ "Redesigns are scary" (direct, relatable opening)

## Sentence Structure

**Patterns:**
- **Vary sentence length** - Mix short punchy statements with longer, more complex explanations
- **Use em dashes liberally** for asides, clarifications, or emphasis (—)
- **Lead with conjunctions** when it creates flow: "But", "And", "So"
- **Parenthetical asides** for additional context or humor

**Examples:**
- ✅ "We knew something had to change. While larger improvements would need time and planning, we immediately prioritized smaller wins..."
- ✅ "Think of Squads as 'after-school clubs' embedded within the workday — an extension of a designer's role, not an extra burden outside of it."

## Paragraph & Section Structure

**Organization:**
- **Lead with the moment** - Start with a specific scene, observation, or problem
- **Use clear headers** - Break up long posts with descriptive subheadings
- **"What Worked / What Didn't Work"** format for case studies
- **Conclude with reflection** - End with learning, question, or call to action

**Typical Flow:**
1. Hook (specific moment/observation)
2. Context/Problem statement
3. Approach/Solution (often with subheaders)
4. Results/Reflection
5. Optional: Credits/Thanks (when appropriate)

## Vocabulary & Language

**Preferences:**
- **American English spelling** - "organization" not "organisation", "color" not "colour"
- **Industry terms used naturally** - Don't over-explain jargon if your audience knows it
- **Concrete over abstract** - Specific examples > theoretical frameworks
- **Active voice preferred** - "We shipped" not "It was shipped"

**Common Jargon (Used Without Explanation):**
- Design/Product: IC, UI/UX, product designer, design system, design tokens, IA, design critique, design review, stakeholder management, prototypes, usability testing, mental models, card sorting, T-shaped designer, spider chart/competency map, Staff Designer
- Business/Org: startup, feature factory, roadmap, pods, squads, hyper-growth, CX, OTP
- Tools: Figma, Sketch, Abstract, Confluence, Asana, Jira, CleverTap, Mixpanel, UXCam, Material Design, React Native, Retool
- Process: sacrificial prototypes, design sprints, UT day

**Avoid:**
- Buzzword-heavy writing
- Overly academic tone
- Hedging language ("perhaps", "maybe", "sort of") unless genuinely uncertain
- Marketing speak

## Storytelling Approach

**Current Style (2022-2025):**
- **Show don't tell** - Use specific scenes and moments
- **Name people** - Credit collaborators by name when relevant
- **Include visuals** - Reference images, screenshots, examples
- **Acknowledge complexity** - "What worked for us might not work for you"
- **Share failures openly** - "our first social media Squad, never quite got off the ground"

**Evolution from 2015 Style:**
Your older writing was more:
- Prescriptive ("Don't let design be a blackbox")
- Listicle-formatted
- Advice-heavy
- Shorter, punchier
- More absolute in statements

Your current writing is:
- **Narrative-driven** with story arcs
- **Nuanced** - acknowledges tradeoffs
- **Collaborative** - uses "we" more than "I"
- **Process-focused** - shows the journey, not just the destination
- **Humble** - admits when things didn't work

## Grammar & Mechanics

**Consistent Choices:**
- **Oxford comma** - Use it
- **Quotation marks** for emphasis or direct speech
- **Em dashes** (—) for breaks, not hyphens (-)
- **Italics** for emphasis or titles (*Rams*)
- **Bold** for key terms or section emphasis

**Numbers:**
- Spell out small numbers in prose ("three months" not "3 months")
- Use numerals for statistics, years, specific counts

## Common Patterns

**Opening Hooks:**
- Personal observation: "During a late-night field visit..."
- Problem statement: "When international travel restrictions eased..."
- Provocative statement: "Design systems often represent an aspirational milestone..."

**Transitions:**
- "That lesson really hit home when..."
- "Here's how we went about it:"
- "What's the best piece of swag you've ever received?"

## Red Flags to Avoid

Based on your corrections:
- ❌ "badly informed" → ✅ "poorly informed"
- ❌ "Infact" → ✅ "In fact"
- ❌ "there-in" → ✅ "therein"
- ❌ Backslash line breaks in markdown
- ❌ British spellings mixed with American

## Content-Specific Guidelines

**For Case Studies:**
- Lead with the problem/moment
- Show your thinking process
- Include "What Worked / What Didn't Work"
- Credit the team when relevant
- End with reflection or invitation for feedback

**For Opinion Pieces:**
- Ground opinions in specific experience
- Acknowledge opposing viewpoints
- Use numbered lists for clarity
- Support with examples or data where possible

**For How-To/Advice:**
- Share the context first
- Acknowledge this worked "for you" not universal truth
- Use specific examples over abstract principles
- Include caveats and limitations

## Key Style Evolution Notes

**2015 vs. 2025:**

Your writing has matured from **prescriptive advice** to **reflective storytelling**:

**Then (2015):**
- "Don't let design be a blackbox"
- "Always be present at all stages"
- More commands, less context
- Shorter, snappier
- Individual contributor perspective

**Now (2025):**
- "That was not how we wanted our products to be used"
- "We knew something had to change"
- More narrative, more nuance
- Longer-form with developed arguments
- Leadership/team perspective
- Acknowledges failure as learning
- More collaborative voice

**Biggest shifts:**
1. From **telling** to **showing**
2. From **"you should"** to **"we tried"**
3. From **certainty** to **thoughtful complexity**
4. From **individual** to **collaborative**
5. From **advice** to **reflection**
