# Kenneth Mark Dsouza

### Product Design manager with experience building and leading design teams in SEA and India.

Recently, I was a senior design manager at [Jiva](https://www.jiva.ag) (2022-2025), an Agritech startup, where I built and led the product design and research team, working on a suite of mobile apps and web apps for users in rural Indonesia. You can read about the work we did in our Medium publication, [Notes from the Fields](https://medium.com/notes-from-the-fields).

Prior to this, I worked at [Gojek](https://www.gojek.com/en-id/) managing a team of designers on the Merchant Platform aka [GoBiz](https://gobiz.co.id/) and at [Practo](https://www.practo.com/providers), an Indian healthcare startup, working on their doctor facing products like [Practo Pro](https://www.practo.com/practo-pro-app).

I used to publish a newsletter for product design managers in the software industry. You can access the [Archives](https://buttondown.com/kenneth/archive/) here.
