# Kenneth Mark Dsouza 

# Product Design manager with experience building and leading design teams in SEA and India.

Recently, I was a senior design manager at [Jiva](https://www.jiva.ag) (2022-2025), an Agritech startup, where I built and led the product design and research team, working on a suite of mobile apps and web apps for users in rural Indonesia. You can read about the work we did in our medium publication, 



Prior to that, I've worked at Gojek and Practo. I started my journey as a designer at [Practo](https://www.practo.com/providers) (2014-2017), an Indian healthcare startup, working on their doctor facing products like [Practo Pro](https://www.practo.com/practo-pro-app). At [Gojek](https://www.gojek.com/en-id/) (2017-2022), an Indonesian startup, I managed a team of designers on the Merchant Platform aka [GoBiz](https://gobiz.co.id/).
