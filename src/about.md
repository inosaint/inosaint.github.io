## About 

Hi, My name is Kenneth Mark Dsouza.

Born and brought up in the coastal city of Mangalore in a Roman catholic household, I pursued a career as an engineer until by a spot of luck I came across the field of design. Post a Master's degree (Information and Interface Design, 2012-2015) from the National Institute of Design, I started my practice as a digital product designer. Now with 7+ years of experience, I am currently a senior design manager with a keen interest in hiring, job ladders and psychological safety.

In my spare time, I like to travel to new places, read non-fiction and contemporary fiction, collect graphic art and write short stories and travelogues.

Want to work with me or discuss a cool project that you are working on?
