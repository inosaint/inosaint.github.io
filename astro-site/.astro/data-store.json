However like many other platformized products, they end up being looked as solutions for use cases they were not designed for. The GoBiz inbox requirement wasn't my first experience with dog fooding, but it was one that I was able to influence positively for the benefit of the users.\n\nWe wanted to build an Inbox, an in-app channel for notifying our users. We just needed one-way communication. I do not understand the reason behind why product pushed to use the SDK, despite the arguments that the SDK wasn't able to support our web product and wasn't designed to communicate business updates.\n\n### Chat is chat, not inbox:\n\nI created a document to explain what that decision meant for the app.\nIf we use the chat sdk, then in the future as other teams build on the chat platform, we should plan to group all kinds of chat in a single space. This would align with the mental model of the user. This space would be the go-to place to follow up on your \"conversations\", whether its about onboarding a new outlet or following up about your GoFresh order.\n\n_Decision:_ We decided that all chats will show up in Inbox but we will need to visually separate them from the business chats. This is something that the Chat team had not yet designed for.\n\n### Where should Inbox/chat go?\n\nGiven that Inbox is something we are considering for communication, it should be easily accessible and indicate unread chats. Given the current structure of the GoBiz app, we could only think of 2 possible positions for the Inbox.\n\nHowever neither of these positions fulfill the conditions of\n\n1. Visibility of new messages: The red dot on Lainnya can't showcase a number since there are several other modules which have a no-number indication.\n\n2. Accessible from various parts of our app: A gofood merchant would jump right to the Orders inbox when they open the app and has no need to aware of this \"notification'\n\n_Decision:_ However without the redesign being prioritized, we decided to keep the entry point on the top right of the 'Lainnya' page.\n\n### Shuffle vs Inbox:\n\n1. Currently there can be overlaps. Overlaps may lead to reduction in importance of Inbox content.\n\n2. Can 'Promo' channel in Inbox be completely replaced by a shuffle card channel on lainnya? because promos need segmentation. Inbox may not work that way.\n\n_Decision:_ No decision yet\n\n### Design iterations\n\nThe Inbox requirement wasn't a new one. 11 months ago, Saneef had worked on how we could introduce communication channels(banner and inbox) in our /existing/ app. [(Aside: His redesign had 'Inbox' as a tab on the bottom navigation)](https://share.goabstract.com/8af61eee-de93-4f63-b0f8-64922742a29e?mode=design&sha=875263ee629f633ddd9229602605e3870884c3da)\n\nWhat was good about this iteration was that latest messages would be visible on the Lainnya page with a way for users to filter different kinds of messages. However this design wouldn't scale well if there were many channels. Think how filters work on Gojek Home's shuffles. Same problem.\n\nWhen we decided to adopt the Chat SDK, it came with a constraint that the view would be a chat window.\n\nSo this constraint causes us to have limited explorations for the channel view. Based on this, here are two iterations that could be possible.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n\nIteration 1 is having a list of channels on the second page, but without the full message so users would need to make an additional click through to get the full message.\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n\nThis exploration attempts to use a notifier informing user about a new message. It could include the text of the message or a generic '1 new message'. In the chat window, we can see the latest message of a channel up front without clicking again to see the message. Even CTAs could be visible here.\n\nSo we went ahead with user-testing with both these iterations, and 'Iteration 2' came out successful.\n\n#### Key Learnings from the research\n\n1. People may ignore the position of the Inbox because of its proximity to the logout button\n\n2. The inbox icon was not understood, so we switched to the envelope icon and called it 'Kotak Pesan'","src/content/projects/gobiz-inbox/index.md","0a1b4cb2adda7b73",{"html":22,"metadata":23},"\u003Cp>The Chat SDK was built to support products wanting to integrate chat into their flows.

During this time, I've lead and contributed towards the GoBiz app and website, the Spots app and the Midtrans website.\n\n### GoBiz app:\n\nWith the formation of a merchant team in mid 2018, I was the designer tasked with the redesign of the GoBiz app.\n\n#### The objectives of the redesign were\n\n1. **Scalability:** The app was moving from being a food merchant app to a merchant app used by different kinds of merchants. So we needed an information architecture that would work for GoFood, GoPay, and other merchants\n2. **UI refresh:** With the move, we rebranded from Go-Resto to GoBiz and adopted the newly minted Asphalt 1.0 design language system. We were the first app in Gojek to be completely built on the Asphalt design system.\n\n#### Design explorations:\n\n#### User testing:\n\nWe decided to have a pilot group of merchants for the release and the research team conducted a user diary research with them.\n\nAs we had not changed any major flow, we did not find any issues.\n\n#### Learnings post release:\n\nOnce we released we started seeing feedback on the playstore asking us why we had hidden the customer contact. In the design, in the interest of showing the list of ordered items, we had moved the customer contact behind an overflow menu. Our analytics had shown low usage of this feature and we felt we could move it and add an onboarding tooltip for the merchants\n\nHowever these complaints persisted and we followed up with a few merchants to understand the problem. We learned that though the merchants did not end up calling via the app, they would want to see the customer phone number either to collect it for marketing purpose, to call from another number or to identify if its a fraud order.\n\nBased on the feedback, we took a call to re-instate the customer number back on the order details screen.\n\n### GoBiz Dashboard:\n\nSometimes you just inherit a product that has not been loved. The GoBiz dashboard was built for enterprise merchants by forking an internal portal. The portal was built on an internal front end framework \"Tanjidor\" and the designers used to design in the browser and this meant that there were no design files. This meant that there was a dependency on the existing designers. So we decided to pick it up as a design initiative.\n\n#### Objectives of the redesign:\n\n1. Reduce dependancy on the existing designer by\n2. Make the dashboard accessible via mobile web\n\n#### What we did:\n\nIn 2019, we conducted a heuristic evaluation to identify key issues. But post that due to issues with design bandwidth, the project was deprioritised.\n\nFast forward to 2020, Hendri joined us on the GoBiz team and I assigned him to start work on the GoBiz Dashboard redesign as a way to familiarise himself with the product.\n\nWe decided to design anything new with our web design system and not do it in the browser. Due to some luck, the \"platformisation\" of the Dashboard project got prioritised that quarter. However the PM was going to do it without a change to the UI. I convinced her to switch to the new UI. But given the sprint was beginning in 2 weeks, we were short of time. So we got a list of pages to work on a priority basis and started exploring. A lot of work was already done by Hendri however we had to now make the whole site look coherent.\n\n> You can arrive at a different output using the same design system.\n\nWe experimented with spacing and separators, navigation menu designs and modal overlays in the next 10 days to finalise the boilerplate for all the pages. Oh and yeah we also made it responsive.\n\n#### What we could not do:\n\n- [ ] Fix the information architecture issues in every page.\n- [ ] Figure out a table design that works well on mobile and desktop\n\n#### Outcome:\n\nThe GoMart designers were able to use the design system and build their module on the Dashboard with limited dependency on our team.\n\n### The Spots app:\n\nThe SPOTS app was a point of sales app on a Landi device. We were selling these to offline merchants to let them collect payment via offline modes like credit card, debit card and QR.\n\nThe app they were using was a reskinned version of the default app provided by Landi(image on the left).\n\nI was asked to help out with it and I worked on a refresh for the app on a short timeline(image on the right)\n\nWe later integrated this into the POS application on the GoBiz app.\n\n### Midtrans:\n\nIn 2020, the Midtrans merchant onboarding was prioritized due to an external collaboration with Whatsapp.\n\nGiven the urgency, I decided to ask Riyadhi to help the team with the wireframes. Riyadhi had previously worked on the merchant onboarding flow for the GoBiz app and I felt this would help us speed up the process.\n\nWe had just completed the platformization exercise so Hendri and Firman were proficient with the new design system. The dev team too was confident that using the web design system was the best decision. This also made the flow mobile web compatible which was one of the identified merchant pain points.\n\nSo we shipped the new onboarding and saw lot of reduction in the drop offs.\n\n#### Outcome:\n\nThis project exposed most of the team to the 'merchant onboarding' problem space and a surprising side-effect of this was that project handover of the 'corporate onboarding' project could be handled by Hendri when Riyadhi was affected by Covid-19.\n\n#### Miscellaneous:\n\nI consulted on the GoBiz and the Midtrans marketing website.","src/content/projects/gojek/index.md","742ea130e0967358",{"html":63,"metadata":64},"\u003Cp>From the last 3 years, I’ve been working on the merchant side of Gojek.

Ray had been the mainstay app for most of\nPracto’s existence, while Profile was created to onboard doctors easily to the marketplace. The Qikwell\napp entered into this mix when we acquired their company earlier in 2015. Maintaining 3 separate\nmobile applications was an overhead for our internal teams as well as for our users. Thus **Project\nSingularity** was born.\n\n## Understanding the problem\nI was not involved in the user research phase of this project. I started work on this project at the\nconceptualisation stage. I worked with Jonathan during this phase. The three apps had different visual\nstyles and interactions and were structured as per their workflows. We needed to integrate these\ntogether without alienating their existing user base while also providing a scalable structure for the\nfuture.\n\n>Our vision was to build one app which needs to become the defacto app for doctors and eventually\nother provider segments\n\nBased on the research conducted, it was understood that a healthcare professional had the following\nneeds; Reputation, Productivity, Marketing, Money and Networking.\n\n[Personas for the unified app]\n\nThe new application had to cater to these needs if it had to be a central point of their life. However,\nthese needs vary as per the standing of the doctor. For e.g., a just graduated doctor would seek to\nlearn more from experienced doctors and would rarely have their own clinic while a doctor with 10\nyears of experience would be focussing on setting up her own business and getting more patients.\nSo first we needed to figure out the information architecture. We started putting all the existing parts\nof the various apps into an excel sheet to get an idea of what the pieces were and we also listed out\nfeatures that we felt could be integrated into the app at a later stage.\n\n[arriving at the information architecture]\n\nWe then started organising this based on how the users would be interacting with them. This is when\nwe started realising that some features seemed redundant while others were incomplete. We then\nlooked at how these various features would be impacted with respect to our user roles.\nWe looked at what are the requirements for a user to access our products as well as how the app\nwould be for users of any of the apps. Thus we were able to finalise the information architecture of the app.\n\n[final information architecture]\n\n## Concepts\nBased on this information architecture, I created few app concepts which we evaluated before\nfinalising on the one we would present to the stakeholders. The final concept was presented as a\ninvision prototype.\n\n[final information architecture]\n\nNotifications, Summary and Settings were concepts that we proposed as part of the new app.\n\n**Notifications:**\nAt that point of time, we did not have a single in-product channel of communication. Most\ncommunication happened either by emails, message bars or blocking dialogs. We wanted to change\nthis so we proposed a Notification Drawer. Further, we categorised as notifications as promotional and\ntransactional and provided users with a way to customise what kind of notifications they would like to\nreceive.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe Summary section was conceived as the newsfeed that would be the landing page for returning\nusers to jump directly into their workflow. It was comprised of stationary widgets and a refreshing\ninfinite newsfeed. The widgets were devised only for transactional products like Ray and Consult. The\nrest of the feed was to be powered by content from our other products like Healthfeed, Synapse and\nConsult.\n\n**Settings:**\nJust like notifications, this did not exist but was an obvious thing to build. We didn't want the user to\nexperience the internal product separations that existed.\nThere were many many meetings and back and forth before we could get everyone to agree that this\nwas the way we should go ahead. During the final discussion with the stakeholders, It was decided\nthat the workflow based structure was too futuristic and we would need to have an interface that lets\nour users understand our offerings. So we shifted to an app grid and widget landing as shown below\ninstead of a feed based landing.\n[final app navigation]\n\n## Detailing\nI led this effort with a team of 3 other designers. Hetang, Akshay and me worked to create the various\nproduct screens while Saloni was responsible for the theme and illustrations. Jonathan was overseeing\nthe entire operation and he gradually transitioned the responsibility to me.\nWe chose a clean content first approach that was becoming popular at that time. It was decided to\nmake the android and iOS apps similar in experience and independent of platforms. I set down the core\nguidelines that we would need to follow to align the various parts of the products. We decided to use\nthe system fonts i.e., Roboto on Android and SF on iOS, when available, for the design. To finalise on\nthe elements, we mocked up key screens within the product to understand and added to our\nguidelines when we found a component that was being used in multiple places.\n[singularity stickersheet]\n\nI created a stickersheet which functioned as a Master file for all the designers. We used a primitive\npeer review process so that the various parts would be consistent and present a coherent experience.\nOur core files would reside within Google Drive and we would work on our versions separately before I\nwould go through everyone’s files before replacing the versions in our core Drive folder.\n\n## Final screens\n\nDuring the implementation, I was the only designer assigned to the project and worked closely with the\ndevelopers to get things right which was how I earned the moniker ‘ceo’ from them.

The economics of sending it to the buyer isnt economically viable for such a small quantity when you factor in labour cost & transport cost. Additionally the ability to evaluate quality at the farmer level is approximate. \n\n[Pricing Graphic]\n[Corn quality (and pricing) is measured in terms of the moisture content of the corn kernels]\n\nCollectors helped fill this gap by aggregating corn for dispatch from multiple farmers and using moisture meters to estimate quality of the corn. \n\nJiva’s business model was working with buyers to acquire purchase orders for the corn and coordinate with the collectors to dispatch to feedmills to get the best price. \nThis wasnt a disruptionary model. The concept of middlemen have always existed in agricultural systems. \n\nWhat was different was the concept of a single entity who’s presence across provinces helped get better prices. \nOur Collectors earned commission for selling through us and our Farmers got the best price. \n\nBut the question remained.. **could we do even better?** and that's where Jiva Lite came in.\n\n\n## Challenge\n\n- One of the reasons we resorted to the micro-collector model was the technical literacy and mobile device penetration in rural Indonesia. Most farmers still used feature phones and many families just had a shared single device usually operated by the children or the wife. For those who did have a smartphone device, local storage and internet were critical constraints. \nIt didn't make sense for them to keep our apps on their phones across seasons and our churn data suggested that as well.\n\n- Our research had shown us that the Sahabat Jiva android app was a complex system compared to the real world way to buying and selling corn\n\n- From the business side, this meant our customer acqusition funnel was fairly expensive and with the commissions and price fluctuations of the market, the Gross Contribution (GC) that we earned per kg was far below what we wanted to be at.\n\n## Solution\n\n![Early Jiva Lite app wireframes](lite-wire.png \"Early Jiva Lite app wireframes\")\n\nThe first idea for Jiva Lite came out of our efforts to simplify the Sahabat Jiva App information architecture and workflows. But it took a few more months before we got a chance to try to solve this.\nThe overwhelming idea at that time was to make another app albeit a \"lite\" one. But a few of us felt that Whatsapp was the way to go. So I used Landbot to quickly prototype how a Whatsapp based flow would look like.\n\n#### Why Whatsapp? \nMeta has deep penetration in Indonesia. Indonesia doesnt have net neutrality laws and hence Meta, Google, Netflix, etc have mobile plans that enabled unlimited usage of their services. \nThis is one of the reason that Facebook and Whatsapp are the communication tool of choice in our users. This meant that \nwe could be assured that unlike a mobile app, our target audience would definitely have Whatsapp on their phones.\n\nAfter pitching this to leadership, we got buyin to use the Whatsapp flow as a pilot project to test out the viability of the Jiva Lite business model.\n\n#### Why was Jiva Lite different?\n- If Jiva Lite had to succeed then it should be economically viable while at the same time, it should not cannibalize our existing businesses. So the pricing logic we set was to keep our offering price at 100idr/kg less than the price we showed in our Sahabat Jiva app. \n- A recent tax exemption made it easy for us to operate at the small scale without needing unnecessary documentation like KTPs\n- For the first time (probably), small holders could sell direct to our buyers irrespective of the volume of their harvest and get paid within a few hours.\n- Meta Ads and Whatsapp QRs let users quickly get into our flow and check prices.\n\n### Building the MVP\nA small team got together to work on this part time. Designing the first flow to be as simple took a few iterations. We used Figma and FigJam a lot to align everyone and used Slack's inbuilt project management system to keep us on track.\nWeekly syncs were run to share progress with the larger group of stakeholders and monthly meetings with the CEO.\n\n![Figjam](./figjam.png \"Blueprinting\")\n\nOur first version was built using Whatsapp Flows and simplified the crop buying flow to just 3 steps; View Prices, Register and Send Truck.\n\n![Designs for the first release version on Figma](./jivalitev1.png \"Designs for the first release version on Figma\")\n\n### Preparing for Go-To-Market\n\nOnboarding internal teams\nWe ran sessions with our field agents, customer service agents and marketing teams to onboard them onto the pilot project. I prepared an \"objection handling\" (a FAQ document) for CX team to use for answering any queries they may receive on their channels.\nSpeaking to our on-ground field agents helped us address their concerns about Jiva Lite and its impact on their operations.\n\nSelecting a region for piloting. \nbased on the time of the year and our micro-collector density, we decided to go with the districts closest to Makassar; Maros and Takalar.
