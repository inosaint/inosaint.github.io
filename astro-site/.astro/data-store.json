Most farmers still used feature phones and many families just had a shared single device usually operated by the children or the wife. For those who did have a smartphone device, local storage and internet were critical constraints. \nIt didn't make sense for them to keep our apps on their phones across seasons and our churn data suggested that as well.\n\n- Our research had shown us that the Sahabat Jiva android app was a complex system compared to the real world way to buying and selling corn\n\n- From the business side, this meant our customer acqusition funnel was fairly expensive and with the commissions and price fluctuations of the market, the Gross Contribution (GC) that we earned per kg was far below what we wanted to be at.\n\n## Solution\n\n![Early Jiva Lite app wireframes](lite-wire.png \"Early Jiva Lite app wireframes\")\n\nThe first idea for Jiva Lite came out of our efforts to simplify the Sahabat Jiva App information architecture and workflows. But it took a few more months before we got a chance to try to solve this.\nThe overwhelming idea at that time was to make another app albeit a \"lite\" one. But a few of us felt that Whatsapp was the way to go. So I used Landbot to quickly prototype how a Whatsapp based flow would look like.\n\n#### Why Whatsapp? \nMeta has deep penetration in Indonesia. Indonesia doesnt have net neutrality laws and hence Meta, Google, Netflix, etc have mobile plans that enabled unlimited usage of their services. \nThis is one of the reason that Facebook and Whatsapp are the communication tool of choice in our users. This meant that \nwe could be assured that unlike a mobile app, our target audience would definitely have Whatsapp on their phones.\n\nAfter pitching this to leadership, we got buyin to use the Whatsapp flow as a pilot project to test out the viability of the Jiva Lite business model.\n\n#### Why was Jiva Lite different?\n- If Jiva Lite had to succeed then it should be economically viable while at the same time, it should not cannibalize our existing businesses. So the pricing logic we set was to keep our offering price at 100idr/kg less than the price we showed in our Sahabat Jiva app. \n- A recent tax exemption made it easy for us to operate at the small scale without needing unnecessary documentation like KTPs\n- For the first time (probably), small holders could sell direct to our buyers irrespective of the volume of their harvest and get paid within a few hours.\n- Meta Ads and Whatsapp QRs let users quickly get into our flow and check prices.\n\n### Building the MVP\nA small team got together to work on this part time. Designing the first flow to be as simple took a few iterations.

However like many other platformized products, they end up being looked as solutions for use cases they were not designed for. The GoBiz inbox requirement wasn't my first experience with dog fooding, but it was one that I was able to influence positively for the benefit of the users.\n\nWe wanted to build an Inbox, an in-app channel for notifying our users.

This space would be the go-to place to follow up on your \"conversations\", whether its about onboarding a new outlet or following up about your GoFresh order.\n\n_Decision:_ We decided that all chats will show up in Inbox but we will need to visually separate them from the business chats. This is something that the Chat team had not yet designed for.\n\n### Where should Inbox/chat go?\n\nGiven that Inbox is something we are considering for communication, it should be easily accessible and indicate unread chats. Given the current structure of the GoBiz app, we could only think of 2 possible positions for the Inbox.\n\nHowever neither of these positions fulfill the conditions of\n\n1. Visibility of new messages: The red dot on Lainnya can't showcase a number since there are several other modules which have a no-number indication.\n\n2. Accessible from various parts of our app: A gofood merchant would jump right to the Orders inbox when they open the app and has no need to aware of this \"notification'\n\n_Decision:_ However without the redesign being prioritized, we decided to keep the entry point on the top right of the 'Lainnya' page.\n\n### Shuffle vs Inbox:\n\n1. Currently there can be overlaps. Overlaps may lead to reduction in importance of Inbox content.\n\n2. Can 'Promo' channel in Inbox be completely replaced by a shuffle card channel on lainnya? because promos need segmentation. Inbox may not work that way.\n\n_Decision:_ No decision yet\n\n### Design iterations\n\nThe Inbox requirement wasn't a new one. 11 months ago, Saneef had worked on how we could introduce communication channels(banner and inbox) in our /existing/ app. [(Aside: His redesign had 'Inbox' as a tab on the bottom navigation)](https://share.goabstract.com/8af61eee-de93-4f63-b0f8-64922742a29e?mode=design&sha=875263ee629f633ddd9229602605e3870884c3da)\n\nWhat was good about this iteration was that latest messages would be visible on the Lainnya page with a way for users to filter different kinds of messages. However this design wouldn't scale well if there were many channels. Think how filters work on Gojek Home's shuffles. Same problem.\n\nWhen we decided to adopt the Chat SDK, it came with a constraint that the view would be a chat window.\n\nSo this constraint causes us to have limited explorations for the channel view. Based on this, here are two iterations that could be possible.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n\nIteration 1 is having a list of channels on the second page, but without the full message so users would need to make an additional click through to get the full message.\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n\nThis exploration attempts to use a notifier informing user about a new message. It could include the text of the message or a generic '1 new message'. In the chat window, we can see the latest message of a channel up front without clicking again to see the message. Even CTAs could be visible here.\n\nSo we went ahead with user-testing with both these iterations, and 'Iteration 2' came out successful.\n\n#### Key Learnings from the research\n\n1. People may ignore the position of the Inbox because of its proximity to the logout button\n\n2. The inbox icon was not understood, so we switched to the envelope icon and called it 'Kotak Pesan'","src/content/projects/gobiz-inbox/index.md","0a1b4cb2adda7b73",{"html":128,"metadata":129},"\u003Cp>The Chat SDK was built to support products wanting to integrate chat into their flows.

During this time, I've lead and contributed towards the GoBiz app and website, the Spots app and the Midtrans website.\n\n### GoBiz app:\n\nWith the formation of a merchant team in mid 2018, I was the designer tasked with the redesign of the GoBiz app.\n\n#### The objectives of the redesign were\n\n1. **Scalability:** The app was moving from being a food merchant app to a merchant app used by different kinds of merchants. So we needed an information architecture that would work for GoFood, GoPay, and other merchants\n2. **UI refresh:** With the move, we rebranded from Go-Resto to GoBiz and adopted the newly minted Asphalt 1.0 design language system. We were the first app in Gojek to be completely built on the Asphalt design system.\n\n#### Design explorations:\n\n#### User testing:\n\nWe decided to have a pilot group of merchants for the release and the research team conducted a user diary research with them.\n\nAs we had not changed any major flow, we did not find any issues.\n\n#### Learnings post release:\n\nOnce we released we started seeing feedback on the playstore asking us why we had hidden the customer contact. In the design, in the interest of showing the list of ordered items, we had moved the customer contact behind an overflow menu. Our analytics had shown low usage of this feature and we felt we could move it and add an onboarding tooltip for the merchants\n\nHowever these complaints persisted and we followed up with a few merchants to understand the problem. We learned that though the merchants did not end up calling via the app, they would want to see the customer phone number either to collect it for marketing purpose, to call from another number or to identify if its a fraud order.\n\nBased on the feedback, we took a call to re-instate the customer number back on the order details screen.\n\n### GoBiz Dashboard:\n\nSometimes you just inherit a product that has not been loved. The GoBiz dashboard was built for enterprise merchants by forking an internal portal. The portal was built on an internal front end framework \"Tanjidor\" and the designers used to design in the browser and this meant that there were no design files. This meant that there was a dependency on the existing designers. So we decided to pick it up as a design initiative.\n\n#### Objectives of the redesign:\n\n1. Reduce dependancy on the existing designer by\n2. Make the dashboard accessible via mobile web\n\n#### What we did:\n\nIn 2019, we conducted a heuristic evaluation to identify key issues. But post that due to issues with design bandwidth, the project was deprioritised.\n\nFast forward to 2020, Hendri joined us on the GoBiz team and I assigned him to start work on the GoBiz Dashboard redesign as a way to familiarise himself with the product.\n\nWe decided to design anything new with our web design system and not do it in the browser. Due to some luck, the \"platformisation\" of the Dashboard project got prioritised that quarter. However the PM was going to do it without a change to the UI. I convinced her to switch to the new UI. But given the sprint was beginning in 2 weeks, we were short of time. So we got a list of pages to work on a priority basis and started exploring. A lot of work was already done by Hendri however we had to now make the whole site look coherent.\n\n> You can arrive at a different output using the same design system.\n\nWe experimented with spacing and separators, navigation menu designs and modal overlays in the next 10 days to finalise the boilerplate for all the pages. Oh and yeah we also made it responsive.\n\n#### What we could not do:\n\n- [ ] Fix the information architecture issues in every page.\n- [ ] Figure out a table design that works well on mobile and desktop\n\n#### Outcome:\n\nThe GoMart designers were able to use the design system and build their module on the Dashboard with limited dependency on our team.\n\n### The Spots app:\n\nThe SPOTS app was a point of sales app on a Landi device. We were selling these to offline merchants to let them collect payment via offline modes like credit card, debit card and QR.\n\nThe app they were using was a reskinned version of the default app provided by Landi(image on the left).\n\nI was asked to help out with it and I worked on a refresh for the app on a short timeline(image on the right)\n\nWe later integrated this into the POS application on the GoBiz app.\n\n### Midtrans:\n\nIn 2020, the Midtrans merchant onboarding was prioritized due to an external collaboration with Whatsapp.\n\nGiven the urgency, I decided to ask Riyadhi to help the team with the wireframes. Riyadhi had previously worked on the merchant onboarding flow for the GoBiz app and I felt this would help us speed up the process.\n\nWe had just completed the platformization exercise so Hendri and Firman were proficient with the new design system. The dev team too was confident that using the web design system was the best decision. This also made the flow mobile web compatible which was one of the identified merchant pain points.\n\nSo we shipped the new onboarding and saw lot of reduction in the drop offs.\n\n#### Outcome:\n\nThis project exposed most of the team to the 'merchant onboarding' problem space and a surprising side-effect of this was that project handover of the 'corporate onboarding' project could be handled by Hendri when Riyadhi was affected by Covid-19.\n\n#### Miscellaneous:\n\nI consulted on the GoBiz and the Midtrans marketing website.","src/content/projects/gojek/index.md","742ea130e0967358",{"html":167,"metadata":168},"\u003Cp>From the last 3 years, I’ve been working on the merchant side of Gojek.

Singapore used to be a major market for the Practo Ray product, and features like Tooth Maps were developed specifically for their dentists. In 2015, when we started rolling out the doctor app to Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Brazil, the major changes we made to the product stopped at currency and number formatting.\n\nHowever when I had to port the GoBiz app to Thailand, I got to learn a lot.\n\n### Collaboration and Organization\n\nGoBiz is a platform with other teams contributing to it so when we prepare for a new country launch, getting every team who is part of the launch involved is crucial.\n\nGiven that the features and the needs may differ across countries, I wanted to organize our projects separately on Abstract. Moreover, each feature/module needs to be a separate sketch file within the project instead of pages within the same sketch file to help manage the size and reduce the interference from other changes in the Master.\n\nDuring the kickoff of a country launch, the Abstract project is setup and a corresponding Asana is set up to function as the tracker for the designs.\nThis project feeds back to the weekly SOS(Scrum of Scrums) that is run by the Program managers.\n\n### Typography:\n\nWhen your product is designed to support a language which only uses latin glyphs, then it's easy to take it to other countries with minimal changes. However with GoBiz, we were designed to support the local language script i.e., Thai in Thailand, Vietnamese in Vietnam and Simplified Chinese in Singapore. This means that the font you use needs to support these scripts. Our brand typeface, Maison Neue, unfortunately wasn't able to support these scripts and the application defaulted to using system fonts. In Thai, this led to the font size and styling getting affected on the screen and we noticed that every merchant we visited during our pilot used accessibility settings to increase the font size breaking the UI.\n\nIn Vietnamese, missing glyphs caused the text to awkwardly renders the missing glyph in another format.\n\nMaison doesn't support the following vietnamese glyphs ờ ư ằ ố ế ữ ả ẻ ễ ỉ ỏ ủ ư ứ ừ ử ữ ự ỷ\n\nSo I worked with the brand and design system team leads to get them to finalize a fallback font which we could use in our designs. We narrowed down on NotoSans as it was a free option that supported what we needed.\n\nMonths after the Thai release, we learnt that to support printing receipts, we would need to do additional development to support Thai and Viet fonts.\n\nP.S. wkwkwkwk and 5555555 are used to indicate laughter in Indonesian and Thai texting culture.\n\n### Managing Copy\n\nManaging designs is fairly easy compared to managing copy across countries.

This means that the font you use needs to support these scripts. Our brand typeface, Maison Neue, unfortunately wasn’t able to support these scripts and the application defaulted to using system fonts.

Ray had been the mainstay app for most of\nPracto’s existence, while Profile was created to onboard doctors easily to the marketplace. The Qikwell\napp entered into this mix when we acquired their company earlier in 2015. Maintaining 3 separate\nmobile applications was an overhead for our internal teams as well as for our users. Thus **Project\nSingularity** was born.\n\n## Understanding the problem\nI was not involved in the user research phase of this project. I started work on this project at the\nconceptualisation stage. I worked with Jonathan during this phase. The three apps had different visual\nstyles and interactions and were structured as per their workflows. We needed to integrate these\ntogether without alienating their existing user base while also providing a scalable structure for the\nfuture.\n\n>Our vision was to build one app which needs to become the defacto app for doctors and eventually\nother provider segments\n\nBased on the research conducted, it was understood that a healthcare professional had the following\nneeds; Reputation, Productivity, Marketing, Money and Networking.\n\n[Personas for the unified app]\n\nThe new application had to cater to these needs if it had to be a central point of their life. However,\nthese needs vary as per the standing of the doctor. For e.g., a just graduated doctor would seek to\nlearn more from experienced doctors and would rarely have their own clinic while a doctor with 10\nyears of experience would be focussing on setting up her own business and getting more patients.\nSo first we needed to figure out the information architecture. We started putting all the existing parts\nof the various apps into an excel sheet to get an idea of what the pieces were and we also listed out\nfeatures that we felt could be integrated into the app at a later stage.\n\n[arriving at the information architecture]\n\nWe then started organising this based on how the users would be interacting with them. This is when\nwe started realising that some features seemed redundant while others were incomplete. We then\nlooked at how these various features would be impacted with respect to our user roles.\nWe looked at what are the requirements for a user to access our products as well as how the app\nwould be for users of any of the apps. Thus we were able to finalise the information architecture of the app.\n\n[final information architecture]\n\n## Concepts\nBased on this information architecture, I created few app concepts which we evaluated before\nfinalising on the one we would present to the stakeholders. The final concept was presented as a\ninvision prototype.\n\n[final information architecture]\n\nNotifications, Summary and Settings were concepts that we proposed as part of the new app.\n\n**Notifications:**\nAt that point of time, we did not have a single in-product channel of communication. Most\ncommunication happened either by emails, message bars or blocking dialogs. We wanted to change\nthis so we proposed a Notification Drawer. Further, we categorised as notifications as promotional and\ntransactional and provided users with a way to customise what kind of notifications they would like to\nreceive.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe Summary section was conceived as the newsfeed that would be the landing page for returning\nusers to jump directly into their workflow. It was comprised of stationary widgets and a refreshing\ninfinite newsfeed. The widgets were devised only for transactional products like Ray and Consult. The\nrest of the feed was to be powered by content from our other products like Healthfeed, Synapse and\nConsult.\n\n**Settings:**\nJust like notifications, this did not exist but was an obvious thing to build. We didn't want the user to\nexperience the internal product separations that existed.\nThere were many many meetings and back and forth before we could get everyone to agree that this\nwas the way we should go ahead. During the final discussion with the stakeholders, It was decided\nthat the workflow based structure was too futuristic and we would need to have an interface that lets\nour users understand our offerings. So we shifted to an app grid and widget landing as shown below\ninstead of a feed based landing.\n[final app navigation]\n\n## Detailing\nI led this effort with a team of 3 other designers. Hetang, Akshay and me worked to create the various\nproduct screens while Saloni was responsible for the theme and illustrations. Jonathan was overseeing\nthe entire operation and he gradually transitioned the responsibility to me.\nWe chose a clean content first approach that was becoming popular at that time. It was decided to\nmake the android and iOS apps similar in experience and independent of platforms. I set down the core\nguidelines that we would need to follow to align the various parts of the products. We decided to use\nthe system fonts i.e., Roboto on Android and SF on iOS, when available, for the design. To finalise on\nthe elements, we mocked up key screens within the product to understand and added to our\nguidelines when we found a component that was being used in multiple places.\n[singularity stickersheet]\n\nI created a stickersheet which functioned as a Master file for all the designers. We used a primitive\npeer review process so that the various parts would be consistent and present a coherent experience.\nOur core files would reside within Google Drive and we would work on our versions separately before I\nwould go through everyone’s files before replacing the versions in our core Drive folder.\n\n## Final screens\n\nDuring the implementation, I was the only designer assigned to the project and worked closely with the\ndevelopers to get things right which was how I earned the moniker ‘ceo’ from them.

Some of these still exist today. While others like Antetype, Invision are no more.\n\nI was taught to design on [Photoshop](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/17928/what-is-the-exact-role-relationship-of-photoshop-in-web-design) at my first job. Even though, modern app stores had released three years earlier, websites was what we were designing back then. The Photoshop art boards we designed, would be ‘sliced’ and used in our HTML/CSS mockups. '[Redlining](https://x.com/teehanlax/status/560820287953195008)' was common practice for dev handovers. For personal projects and at hackathons, new age CSS/JS libraries like [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/1.0.0/) started being used. The designs I made back then are horrible and still exist in un-recoverable file formats (Okay, I actually found a photo of [one design](https://photos.app.goo.gl/yx1heXKvGiAFAkNn7)).

Outside in the world, the industry was using tools like Axure, Omnigraffle and Keynote and Teehan+Lax had legendary status in their community for their annual release of their iOS kits.\n\n![Teehan+Lax pictured in their iconic profile photo](./lookback-design-tools-2.jpg)\n\nBy the time we graduated, there had been changes in this ecosystem. Sketch started picking up market share, smart phone penetration was trending up and collaboration became an important buzzword. It was 2014.\n\nBy the time, I started my internship, Material Design had launched and I upgraded from my ancient Sony Viao to a MacBook Air (on EMI). We adopted Sketch and Marvelapp at my workplace.\n\n![My first Marvelapp prototype - June 2014. Created for my Master's submission, still seems to work.](./lookback-design-tools-3.png)\n\nBack then, Sketch files were saved in Google Drive Shared Drives for archival and access across the team. You still needed a license to access proprietary content so we still needed to redline screens and share exports in folders. This lead to tools like Zeplin, Invision and Marvelapp coming in to fill this gap. The next year, Facebook released [Origami](https://engineering.fb.com/2015/02/24/ios/introducing-origami-live/) built on top of Quartz Composer followed by [Framer 1.0](https://medium.com/insightdesign/this-is-how-i-tried-framer-in-8-active-hours-trial-c4a8a0392267) in the next year. That was the start of making prototypes multi-dimensional and letting users “interact” with UI elements and granting access to device hardware sensors like camera. There were [people](https://medium.com/framer-prototyping/making-framer-prototypes-talk-to-each-other-web-sockets-framer-85eedd2243aa) [that I](https://dribbble.com/shots/3699875-Life-Advices-app-Concept/attachments/9971472?mode=media) [knew](https://x.com/vikxlp/status/893453311210250240) making really cool stuff with this.\n\n![An Android date selector prototype I designed on Pixate and got implemented in 2015](./lookback-design-tools-4.png)\n\nNext, Figma and Abstract started up trying to solve the file organization and collaboration problem in their own way; Figma’s USP was that it was browser based and hence could be used by non-mac users so great for budding designers who couldn’t afford a Mac. I didn't use Figma until Jan 2022.\n\nAbstract targeted the existing Sketch user base and tried to introduce branching to the designer audience (albeit unsuccessfully?). [Framer X](https://blog.prototypr.io/framer-x-preview-9d067f35cf9a) built some hype but it didn’t catch on. I had beta access and building out a component system on Framer X(React) needed Dev support which most design teams didn’t have the luxury of. This (circa 2019) is when you started noticing design teams around the world having UX Engineers in their rosters. Design systems evolved out of style guides with the help of UX engineering and now we take design sytems to have both a design and code aspect to them along with voice, tone, illustrations, etc.\n\n![A responsive no-code app I built on Glide to help me expense bills for work travel](./lookback-design-tools-5.png)\n\nThen came the no-code/low-code revolution which simplified the ease of creation further and tools like Glideapps, Bubble and Landbot now make it easy for you to prototype and share ideas.

I recommend that you ask the hiring manager this question during your interview rounds and also ask to speak to the critical members in the team you will be joining.

The adoption of using it for software designers got a shot in the arm when [Facebook adopted it](https://qr.ae/pGQdVi) for their designers. Until then UI/UX was the term of choice for folks in the industry and used to indicate a specific job that the designer performed in the team. This was indicative of the shift from the delivery teams working with client requirements (enterprise first) to product teams (rapidly iterating consumer tech) which had to learn and uncover what was the best product they could build. Due to the scarcity of product designers in the space, companies started acquiring design agencies around the world \\[1\\].\n\nThe ‘product designer’ now had to start looking at what they are designing as a product and not be restricted by your traditional mindset of UI and UX responsibilities. This would mean that they would need to learn about business, uncover user insights, use data analytic tools, have technical understanding, etc to design their product. These aren’t skills that come naturally to designers and there-in lay the problem. Not every designer wanted to be a “product designer” but it was an aspirational job for designers given the pay packages were miles ahead of what designers were paid in other industries. More and more companies started adopting the term of ‘product designer’ to follow industry trends and attract talent.\n\nBut even then there were few orgs which took design seriously.\n\n![Source: 2014 interview in Dezeen [2]](./product-designer-1.png)\n\nEven today, most orgs don’t really provide a space for designers to thrive in the product space and even today, there are probably a handful of product designers and product orgs in the world, the rest is mostly good PR.\n\nAnd what are the aspects of a product designer that sets them apart from other designers?\n\n### Quality\n\nThe primary aspect the product designer optimises for is quality of delivery. Quality being subjective makes it hard for the different disciplines to align over what this means. For me, it means that the product designer needs to understand the constraints of business and development to be able to deliver the best outcome possible in the defined timeline. You may want to build that perfect animated transition, but let’s be real, that’s not really a user need most of the time. The product’s usage and success should be the thing driving you towards excelling as a designer.\n\n![](./product-designer-2.jpg)\n\n### Curiosity\n\nJust like Alice, a product designer has to be inquisitive about their users and their behaviour and the systems they inhabit. The ‘product designer’ need to be comfortable looking at dashboards, analyzing events as well as drafting a research plan and talking to users. The best way to level up as a product designer is to learn from what you are building and putting out into the world. And this learning tends to compound as the years go by and helps you take decisions when faced with new design challenges.\n\n### Craft\n\nThe product designer is actually [T-shaped](https://spotify.design/article/finding-your-t-shape-as-a-generalist-designer) despite a lot of folks thinking that they are generalists. So although the industry largely refers to the visual polish as ‘craft’, I don’t feel its restricted to just that. You could be a ‘product designer’ excelling at copy writing, or a ‘product designer’ inclined towards the code side. A good team is made of many such designers who can learn from each other. If every designer you hire (or in your team) has a similar skill set to you then there would be limited direction for you to grow in. Some teams out there have chosen to double down on this kind of team building but to me that’s building a design specialist team.\n\n### Agency\n\nThis is a quality which is rare to find.

The adoption of using it for software designers got a shot in the arm when \u003Ca href=\"https://qr.ae/pGQdVi\">Facebook adopted it\u003C/a> for their designers. Until then UI/UX was the term of choice for folks in the industry and used to indicate a specific job that the designer performed in the team. This was indicative of the shift from the delivery teams working with client requirements (enterprise first) to product teams (rapidly iterating consumer tech) which had to learn and uncover what was the best product they could build. Due to the scarcity of product designers in the space, companies started acquiring design agencies around the world [1].\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The ‘product designer’ now had to start looking at what they are designing as a product and not be restricted by your traditional mindset of UI and UX responsibilities. This would mean that they would need to learn about business, uncover user insights, use data analytic tools, have technical understanding, etc to design their product. These aren’t skills that come naturally to designers and there-in lay the problem. Not every designer wanted to be a “product designer” but it was an aspirational job for designers given the pay packages were miles ahead of what designers were paid in other industries. More and more companies started adopting the term of ‘product designer’ to follow industry trends and attract talent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But even then there were few orgs which took design seriously.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure class=\"image-figure\">\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./product-designer-1.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Source: 2014 interview in Dezeen [2]&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003Cfigcaption>Source: 2014 interview in Dezeen [2]\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>\n\u003Cp>Even today, most orgs don’t really provide a space for designers to thrive in the product space and even today, there are probably a handful of product designers and product orgs in the world, the rest is mostly good PR.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what are the aspects of a product designer that sets them apart from other designers?\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"quality\">Quality\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The primary aspect the product designer optimises for is quality of delivery. Quality being subjective makes it hard for the different disciplines to align over what this means. For me, it means that the product designer needs to understand the constraints of business and development to be able to deliver the best outcome possible in the defined timeline. You may want to build that perfect animated transition, but let’s be real, that’s not really a user need most of the time. The product’s usage and success should be the thing driving you towards excelling as a designer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure class=\"image-figure\">\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./product-designer-2.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/figure>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"curiosity\">Curiosity\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Just like Alice, a product designer has to be inquisitive about their users and their behaviour and the systems they inhabit. The ‘product designer’ need to be comfortable looking at dashboards, analyzing events as well as drafting a research plan and talking to users. The best way to level up as a product designer is to learn from what you are building and putting out into the world. And this learning tends to compound as the years go by and helps you take decisions when faced with new design challenges.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"craft\">Craft\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The product designer is actually \u003Ca href=\"https://spotify.design/article/finding-your-t-shape-as-a-generalist-designer\">T-shaped\u003C/a> despite a lot of folks thinking that they are generalists. So although the industry largely refers to the visual polish as ‘craft’, I don’t feel its restricted to just that. You could be a ‘product designer’ excelling at copy writing, or a ‘product designer’ inclined towards the code side. A good team is made of many such designers who can learn from each other. If every designer you hire (or in your team) has a similar skill set to you then there would be limited direction for you to grow in. Some teams out there have chosen to double down on this kind of team building but to me that’s building a design specialist team.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"agency\">Agency\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This is a quality which is rare to find.

In fact, there are a lot of highly [priced](https://maven.com/rachel-kobetz/dls-career-architecture) [leadership](https://www.designdept.co/series/design-leadership-fundamentals) [training](https://www.aiga.org/design/design-leadership) courses out there these days.\n\nOver my career of 10 odd years, I’ve had the honour of being an observer in the product design industry of 2 countries; India and Indonesia. My perspective comes from my vantage point of living in the Silicon Valley of India and professionally, from being part of the growth stage of the well funded startups.\n\nFor this article(rant?), I will use Startups vs Big Tech for sake of categorisation. Big tech would have the minimum expectation of being a listed company operating across more than 1 geographical region. Meta and the other MAANG companies would fall into big tech but do remember that they are the new entrants in a space already filled by CISCO, Intuit, Adobe.\n\nPost the dot-com bust, we saw the slow rise of today’s modern digital startups. First in the Silicon Valley and then in the rest of the world. This was mainly fuelled by the VC funding and still is. This lead us to look up to the Silicon Valley companies and the folks there as thought leaders for design. And rightly so since they were working on products we admired and used half a world away. That scale and magnitude is definitely something to be proud of. They encountered and solved problems at scale, establishing standards, registering patents and forming user behaviours that we take for granted today\n\nBut in our part of the world, even today, digital product design is still attempting to break out of its UI and UX tags. When I started out in 2014, UI/UX was the predominant way of describing designers in big tech, and even startups. Of course there were exceptions, but I will ignore them as outliers. The startup I worked at back then, was one of the first in India to adopt Facebook’s popular convention to start using the term ‘Product Designer’. Back then, the Indian digital design industry was so small. You were separated by 1-2 degrees from everyone and arguably, it’s still that small. The VC funding however gave rise to a notion that tech startups are a lucrative career compared to the dominant IT/ITES industry. This led to a gold rush fuelled by opportunistic bootcamps and certification courses, most of which churned out low skill designers. However, unlike the West, few companies thrived and hardly any have scaled and now we have a supply-demand problem at hand.\n\nThis leads us to where we are today:\n\n1. Local companies are not getting ‘Big’ enough or if they are, once they get listed, they need to justify costs and respond to the market. It’s quite easy for decision makers to take that call and cut a few roles to keep costs in check. Easier than getting out of your software license contracts to cut costs. Also much easier to do this when others in the industry are also doing layoffs. Smaller companies imply that there are fewer senior roles to be filled especially when most teams out there are feature factories who know what to build next.\n\n2. In my experience, Design leaders in startups have always been expected to play a dual role of designer + manager. Infact the designer aspect is valued a lot more while the manager title is granted to keep designers happy. That said, Most companies do not know what to do with the design leaders that they hire. So often, what you encounter is the Design Leader who is a figurehead to appease the junior designers with almost 0 influence on business outcomes or worst case, to be head of design of a design team of 1. This explains the short tenures because those roles are just not fulfilling.\n\n3. This may anger a few, but in the current state of the industry, design progression ladders don’t need an IC track beyond the level of a senior designer of 5-6 years of experience. If you are not a Meta/Google, I don’t expect there to be scope or complexity that needs Staff Designers. So where have these senior designers been going? Well some of them move into “Manager” roles without the skills to operate in them while others tend to move out of the country to join companies which may have grown to a larger size or worst case at least they get to experience a new culture.\n\n4. The skills you need as a manager are different from the ones you polished as an IC designer. Being good at Figma can only take you so far, if you don’t have an affinity for bureaucracy, then being a manager is a bad fit. On the other extreme are the managers and heads of design, usually from a background in older big tech companies, who were at positions where their job was to pontificate about design and innovation. These folk tend to be disconnected from the day-to-day work and that’s bad for the team as well. Both of these are highly replaceable roles.\n\n5. And finally, we have not moved away from the worker productivity categorisation of industrialisation. Bell curves are common, business wants to keep control and budgets are paramount. I would like to argue that Design never got a seat at the table. The “Design Thinking” hype that got thrown around by IBM, McKinsey, IDEO was for their own PR and has run its due course. Everyone likes an optimistic story but rarely would you find actual organisation leaders(CXOs) believing in the value that Design brings to the business and actually investing into Design. That is as true today, as it was a decade ago and hence good fulfilling design jobs are few and far between. \\\n   \\\n   This does not paint a very rosy picture of today's design industry but after all these years, this is my honest take on the state of affairs.
