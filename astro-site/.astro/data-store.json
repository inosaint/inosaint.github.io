[Part 1](https://kenneth.dsouza.im/writing/hiring/) was written in 2020-21, when I was on interview panels for product design and product management. Whereas Part 2 consists of my reflections\nafter being in the role of the hiring manager and co-designing Jiva's hiring process.\n\n### 1. Your hiring process is a reflection of your culture\n\nThe design hiring process isn't standardised. These days you'll see a variety of rounds; visual portfolios, take-home assignments, whiteboarding sessions, etc. The mix you choose isn't random; it's a *reflection* of your organization's culture. You're designing a candidate's very first experience of how your team thinks and works.\n\nDifferent rounds signal different things. Asking for visual designs in a portfolio implies that your product team drives the flows and you need someone with strong visual craft. Take-home assignments (and their subsequent presentation) reveal the candidate's communication skills, which can be especially useful if your team works in a traditional \"siloed\" setup. Collaborative whiteboarding sessions show you how it feels to partner with them day-to-day but usually your organization's designers work solo within their own teams.\n\nNone of these are inherently wrong. But if you are not mindful about your processes you end up unnecessarily making the candidate experience time consuming, anxiety-filled, and worse, you start evaluating candidates for the wrong set of attributes — a costly mistake that almost always leads to failure down the line. \n\u003C!-- (You can read about how we designed our product design hiring process at Jiva here.) -->\n\n\n### 2. Today’s design team needs to be multi-faceted\n\nWhen I first started taking interviews (in 2015), my evaluation criteria naturally leaned toward a certain kind of product designer — usually someone whose strengths mirrored what **I** personally valued. That worked when every designer owned a single product end-to-end. But as the organization grew, this approach started breaking down. Designers now had to work together, share problem spaces, and complement one another's strengths rather than operate in isolation and we hadn't hired for that.\n\nA better approach — and one I wish I had learnt earlier[^1] — is to step back and visualise your team's skillset as a whole. One simple way to do this is by mapping your organization's design competencies onto a rough [spider chart or competency map](https://medium.com/shapingdesign/the-ux-spectrum-cb29f048faf9)[^2] and plotting each designer against it. It doesn’t need to be perfect; the point is to create a shared view of where your team is strong, where it’s weak, and if you’re overly dependent on the skills of a single person.  \n\n![UX Spectrum via Jason Mesut's Shaping Design series](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*Vi4kDiI5uLhlXJdztg7lwg.png)\n\nThis kind of visualisation becomes even more valuable when you’re managing multiple teams or products. It gives you clarity on what gaps you’re trying to fill, instead of defaulting to hiring “more of the same.” For example, pairing a highly visual designer with a more analytical one can create a healthier balance, with each designer taking control of the tasks as per their skill sets.  \n\nIn other words, what you need to realise is that you are not hiring an individual — you’re shaping the distribution of strengths and weaknesses across your entire design function.  \n\n\n### 3. There is no place for ego in the team\n\nIt’s called a design team for a reason. The product the user experiences should feel seamless, not like a patchwork of different personalities, preferences, or stylistic signatures. One of the biggest gaps in a skills-only evaluation is that it completely misses the *collaboration layer* of design: how someone shows up, how they listen, and how they work with others under pressure.  \n\nYour spider chart or competency map can show you strengths and weaknesses in craft, but it won't tell you whether a candidate can actually work well with the rest of your organization. That’s where cultural alignment matters. A designer who is stubborn, who refuses to take cross-functional feedback, or insists on “their way” will quickly become a bottleneck — no matter how talented they are.  \n\nGetting people who play well together is one of the most underrated aspects of building a high-performing design org. A difficult personality erodes trust, slows down execution, and adds unnecessary emotional weight on everyone else — a mess that you, as the design manager, will spend a lot of time and energy sorting out.  \n\nThis is why running a “vibe check” through your existing team — designers, PMs, engineers — can be invaluable. These aren’t popularity tests; they’re ways to sense how someone collaborates in real, messy, day-to-day situations and to check how excited stakeholders are about working with the candidate.\n\nThe goal isn’t to hire the best individual — it’s to hire the person who will make the team stronger.\n\n\n\u003Cp class=\"attribution\"> Cover image: Akshay, Hetang and Riya working on a whiteboard at Practo, 4 April 2017\u003C/p>\n\n[^1]: Derived learning from faculty from Ownpath Manager training in Q1 2020 where we interacted with Kristin Skinner, Alysha Naples, and Meredith Black.\n[^2]: Jason Mesut's Shaping Design series of posts is full of useful toolkits and design management frameworks.","src/content/writing/hiring-2/index.md",[22],"./whiteboard.JPG","b23c68bc14f2b699",{"html":25,"metadata":26},"\u003Cp>There are lot of opinions out there about hiring. \u003Ca href=\"https://kenneth.dsouza.im/writing/hiring/\">Part 1\u003C/a> was written in 2020-21, when I was on interview panels for product design and product management.

In fact, there are a lot of highly [priced](https://maven.com/rachel-kobetz/dls-career-architecture) [leadership](https://www.designdept.co/series/design-leadership-fundamentals) [training](https://www.aiga.org/design/design-leadership) courses out there these days.\n\nOver my career of 10 odd years, I’ve had the honour of being an observer in the product design industry of 2 countries; India and Indonesia. My perspective comes from my vantage point of living in the Silicon Valley of India and professionally, from being part of the growth stage of the well funded startups.\n\nFor this article(rant?), I will use Startups vs Big Tech for sake of categorisation. Big tech would have the minimum expectation of being a listed company operating across more than 1 geographical region. Meta and the other MAANG companies would fall into big tech but do remember that they are the new entrants in a space already filled by CISCO, Intuit, Adobe.\n\nPost the dot-com bust, we saw the slow rise of today’s modern digital startups. First in the Silicon Valley and then in the rest of the world. This was mainly fuelled by the VC funding and still is. This lead us to look up to the Silicon Valley companies and the folks there as thought leaders for design. And rightly so since they were working on products we admired and used half a world away. That scale and magnitude is definitely something to be proud of. They encountered and solved problems at scale, establishing standards, registering patents and forming user behaviours that we take for granted today\n\nBut in our part of the world, even today, digital product design is still attempting to break out of its UI and UX tags. When I started out in 2014, UI/UX was the predominant way of describing designers in big tech, and even startups. Of course there were exceptions, but I will ignore them as outliers. The startup I worked at back then, was one of the first in India to adopt Facebook's popular convention to start using the term 'Product Designer'. Back then, the Indian digital design industry was so small. You were separated by 1-2 degrees from everyone and arguably, it's still that small. The VC funding, however, gave rise to a notion that tech startups are a lucrative career compared to the dominant IT/ITES industry. This led to a gold rush fuelled by opportunistic bootcamps and certification courses, most of which churned out low skill designers. However, unlike the West, few companies thrived and hardly any have scaled and now we have a supply-demand problem at hand.\n\nThis leads us to where we are today:\n\n1. Local companies are not getting 'Big' enough or if they are, once they get listed, they need to justify costs and respond to the market. It's quite easy for decision makers to take that call and cut a few roles to keep costs in check. Easier than getting out of your software license contracts to cut costs. Also much easier to do this when others in the industry are also doing layoffs. Smaller companies mean there are fewer senior roles to be filled especially when most teams out there are feature factories who know what to build next.\n\n2. In my experience, Design leaders in startups have always been expected to play a dual role of designer + manager. In fact the designer aspect is valued a lot more while the manager title is granted to keep designers happy. That said, Most companies do not know what to do with the design leaders that they hire. So often, what you encounter is the Design Leader who is a figurehead to appease the junior designers with almost 0 influence on business outcomes or worst case, to be head of design of a design team of 1. This explains the short tenures because those roles are just not fulfilling.\n\n3. This may anger a few, but in the current state of the industry, design progression ladders don’t need an IC track beyond the level of a senior designer of 5-6 years of experience. If you are not a Meta/Google, I don’t expect there to be scope or complexity that needs Staff Designers. So where have these senior designers been going? Well some of them move into “Manager” roles without the skills to operate in them while others tend to move out of the country to join companies which may have grown to a larger size or worst case at least they get to experience a new culture.\n\n4. The skills you need as a manager are different from the ones you polished as an IC designer. Being good at Figma can only take you so far, if you don’t have an affinity for bureaucracy, then being a manager is a bad fit. On the other extreme are the managers and heads of design, usually from a background in older big tech companies, who were at positions where their job was to pontificate about design and innovation. These folk tend to be disconnected from the day-to-day work and that’s bad for the team as well. Both of these are highly replaceable roles.\n\n5. And finally, we have not moved away from the worker productivity categorisation of industrialisation. Bell curves are common, business wants to keep control and budgets are paramount. I would like to argue that Design never got a seat at the table. The \"Design Thinking\" hype that got thrown around by IBM, McKinsey, IDEO was for their own PR and has run its due course. Everyone likes an optimistic story but rarely would you find actual organization leaders(CXOs) believing in the value that Design brings to the business and actually investing into Design. That is as true today, as it was a decade ago and hence good fulfilling design jobs are few and far between.\n\n   This does not paint a very rosy picture of today's design industry but after all these years, this is my honest take on the state of affairs. Perhaps we've been swayed by all the positive marketing around design, perhaps we've believed that design in tech can save the world, but in reality, designers find themselves in a dystopia that they don't want to acknowledge. The old folks of the industry who have survived, will continue to do so but if you are a beginner, if you want to stick to design in tech, I recommend that you choose a discipline like engineering or product instead and leave your empathy at the door.","src/content/writing/design-in-tech-2024/index.md",[58],"./4IiQQOEdmqPcCsjTqlta-1.png","810211681d2c5d00",{"html":61,"metadata":62},"\u003Cp>After the Great Layoffs, I’ve been seeing too many people declaring the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91027996/the-big-design-freak-out-a-generation-of-design-leaders-grapple-with-their-future\">death\u003C/a> of \u003Ca href=\"https://medium.com/@martynreding/how-to-survive-the-design-leadership-reckoning-ff2856bf4733\">design\u003C/a> leadership and with the rise of AI, the death of the digital design industry as well. but I find that it’s a poorly informed take and no offence, but in my opinion, written by outsiders or written about a specific industry/region/designer.

The old folks of the industry who have survived, will continue to do so but if you are a beginner, if you want to stick to design in tech, I recommend that you choose a discipline like engineering or product instead and leave your empathy at the door.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>",{"headings":63,"localImagePaths":64,"remoteImagePaths":65,"frontmatter":66,"imagePaths":68},[],[],[],{"title":51,"description":52,"date":67,"image":58},"2024-01-01",[],"design-in-tech-2024/index.md","process",{"id":70,"data":72,"body":77,"filePath":78,"assetImports":79,"digest":81,"rendered":82,"legacyId":101},{"title":73,"description":74,"date":75,"image":76,"status":18},"Beyond building processes at GoMerchant Design Team","Team process and documentation",["Date","2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z"],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_./process-1.png","A considerable amount of time in 'Year 1' of being a manager has been about setting up artifacts and processes.

Design systems evolved out of style guides with the help of UX engineering and now we take design sytems to have both a design and code aspect to them along with voice, tone, illustrations, etc.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigure class=\"image-figure\">\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./lookback-design-tools-5.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;A responsive no-code app I built on Glide to help me expense bills for work travel&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003Cfigcaption>A responsive no-code app I built on Glide to help me expense bills for work travel\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>\n\u003Cp>Then came the no-code/low-code revolution which simplified the ease of creation further and tools like Glideapps, Bubble and Landbot now make it easy for you to prototype and share ideas.

Them being the solo designer shouldn’t directly impact their effectiveness.\n\nHere’s what I feel matters the most towards their success:\n\n### 1. What is your role?\n\nKnowing why they opened the designer role is important before you take that job. I recommend that you ask the hiring manager this question during your interview rounds and also ask to speak to the critical members in the team you will be joining. I take it that most Founders open a position because they got some feedback from customers or because their investor told them to. They may not be ready to invest in what can make a designer effective in their role.\n\n### 2. Fitting into the team:\n\nThe team would need to adapt to having an in-house designer working with them. The team members would need to understand what the role of the designer is and how they could work with them. They would need to take time to adapt their workflows or create new inclusive processes. All this is hard to do and the designer(especially a junior one) wouldn’t do very well without a sponsor.\n\n### 3. You need a sponsor.\n\nOne of my key learnings has been to choose to work with someone who will be your advocate in the organization. It's the single most important thing to look for during the interview process. The best teams I've observed had CEOs being the design sponsor and their products tend to win at least in terms of product quality (a product's success is more than it's quality, but that's another post) Don't believe me? Well in *Rams*, Dieter Rams states \"If you don't have someone who stands behind you, then you can forget it.\" And cites it as a reason for leaving Braun.\n\nOf course, not every Startup out there succeeds and there's no guarantee that the team you join will survive but its always good to make sure that you enjoy the team you spend there and learn how to become a better designer.\n\nIf you are looking for advice on what you can do as a solo designer to succeed, [this post I wrote after my first year as a designer](https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/what-every-young-designer-should-know-abb2af79f43e) may be useful.","src/content/writing/solo-designer/index.md",[159],"./solo-designer-jobs-1.png","134f374691447467",{"html":162,"metadata":163},"\u003Cp>You often see people stating that they are joining as a solo designer in a Startup and want advice.

The adoption of using it for software designers got a shot in the arm when [Facebook adopted it](https://qr.ae/pGQdVi) for their designers. Until then UI/UX was the term of choice for folks in the industry and used to indicate a specific job that the designer performed in the team. This was indicative of the shift from the delivery teams working with client requirements (enterprise first) to product teams (rapidly iterating consumer tech) which had to learn and uncover what was the best product they could build. Due to the scarcity of product designers in the space, companies started acquiring design agencies around the world[^1].\n\nThe 'product designer' now had to start looking at what they are designing as a product and not be restricted by your traditional mindset of UI and UX responsibilities. This would mean that they would need to learn about business, uncover user insights, use data analytic tools, have technical understanding, etc to design their product. These aren't skills that come naturally to designers and therein lay the problem. Not every designer wanted to be a “product designer” but it was an aspirational job for designers given the pay packages were miles ahead of what designers were paid in other industries. More and more companies started adopting the term of ‘product designer’ to follow industry trends and attract talent.\n\nBut even then there were few orgs which took design seriously.\n\n![Source: 2014 interview in Dezeen](./product-designer-1.png)[^2]\n\nEven today, most orgs don’t really provide a space for designers to thrive in the product space and even today, there are probably a handful of product designers and product orgs in the world, the rest is mostly good PR.\n\n**And what are the aspects of a product designer that sets them apart from other designers?**\n\n### Quality\n\nThe primary aspect the product designer optimises for is quality of delivery. Quality being subjective makes it hard for the different disciplines to align over what this means. For me, it means that the product designer needs to understand the constraints of business and development to be able to deliver the best outcome possible in the defined timeline. You may want to build that perfect animated transition, but let’s be real, that’s not really a user need most of the time. The product’s usage and success should be the thing driving you towards excelling as a designer.\n\n![](./product-designer-2.jpg)\n\n### Curiosity\n\nJust like Alice, a product designer has to be inquisitive about their users and their behaviour and the systems they inhabit. The ‘product designer’ need to be comfortable looking at dashboards, analyzing events as well as drafting a research plan and talking to users. The best way to level up as a product designer is to learn from what you are building and putting out into the world. And this learning tends to compound as the years go by and helps you take decisions when faced with new design challenges.\n\n### Craft\n\nThe product designer is actually [T-shaped](https://spotify.design/article/finding-your-t-shape-as-a-generalist-designer) despite a lot of folks thinking that they are generalists. So although the industry largely refers to the visual polish as 'craft', I don't feel its restricted to just that. You could be a 'product designer' excelling at copy writing, or a 'product designer' inclined towards the code side. A good team is made of many such designers who can learn from each other. If every designer you hire (or in your team) has a similar skill set to you then there would be limited direction for you to grow in. Some teams out there have chosen to double down on this kind of team building but to me that's building a design specialist team.[^3]\n\n### Agency\n\nThis is a quality which is rare to find. I feel this is because most designers tend to be introverts and love to be comfortable in their “space”. It’s easy to spend time in the world making pixel perfection your entire personality, it’s not easy to go out on a limb and argue for a decision to be made. Unfortunately, agency is what helps you level up the ranks. Agency is what gets you a seat at the table. Another hurdle towards product designers developing agency is that they need to be part of good teams run by design leaders who support and sponsor you and those are really scarce in supply.\n\n### So where do we go from here?\n\n* I see that we need to address this at a system level, today the ‘product design’ comes with a better salary and so for designers to get better pay it’s better to call themselves Product Designers. So things can’t change until the hiring parties don’t get better at their jobs.\n\n* No one designer is the same as the other. Organisations should be cognizant that there are no such thing as generalists and design their career rubrics in a way to suit the different kinds of designers on their team. This helps each designer to grow in their own way within the org.\n\n* Job descriptions could be honest up front of the kind of designer that they are looking for rather than getting ChatGPT to write it. There is no point lying about this, infact it just takes you lot longer to find someone.\n\n\n[^1]: **John Maeda's Design in Tech report 2015, Slide 4** https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/design-in-tech-report-2015-45858974/45858974\n\n[^2]: **Silicon Valley \"didn't think a designer could build a company\" says Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky** https://www.dezeen.com/2014/01/28/silicon-valley-didnt-think-a-designer-could-build-a-company-interview-airbnb-co-founder-brian-chesky/\n\n[^3]: **Pablo Stanley, Collection of Random Comics** https://thedesignteam.io/collection-of-random-comics-d66f32ee9c52\n\n\n\u003Cp class=\"attribution\"> This post was my response to Sidu's \u003Ca href=\"https://sidu.in/essays/hiring-product-managers.html\">Hiring Product Managers\u003C/a> and John Allspaw's \u003Ca href=\"https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/\">On being a Senior Engineer\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp class=\"attribution\"> Attribution: Cover image courtesy \u003Cstrong>'The Process of Design Squiggle' by Damien Newman, thedesignsquiggle.com\u003C/strong> \u003C/p>","src/content/writing/product-designer/index.md",[220,221,222],"./product-designer-1.png","./product-designer-2.jpg","./squiggle-labels-outline.jpg","595da99918ce871b",{"html":225,"metadata":226},"\u003Cp>A decade ago, the ‘product designer’ title was being used to refer to designers (and still is) working on physical products.

However with GoBiz, we were designed to support the local language script i.e., Thai in Thailand, Vietnamese in Vietnam and Simplified Chinese in Singapore. This means that the font you use needs to support these scripts. Our brand typeface, Maison Neue, unfortunately wasn't able to support these scripts and the application defaulted to using system fonts. In Thai, this led to the font size and styling getting affected on the screen and we noticed that every merchant we visited during our pilot used accessibility settings to increase the font size breaking the UI.\n\nIn Vietnamese, missing glyphs caused the text to awkwardly render the missing glyph in another format.\n\nMaison doesn't support the following vietnamese glyphs ờ ư ằ ố ế ữ ả ẻ ễ ỉ ỏ ủ ư ứ ừ ử ữ ự ỷ\n\nSo I worked with the brand and design system team leads to get them to finalize a fallback font which we could use in our designs.

However like many other platformized products, they end up being looked as solutions for use cases they were not designed for. The GoBiz inbox requirement wasn't my first experience with dog fooding, but it was one that I was able to influence positively for the benefit of the users.\n\nWe wanted to build an Inbox, an in-app channel for notifying our users. We just needed one-way communication. I do not understand the reason behind why product pushed to use the SDK, despite the arguments that the SDK wasn't able to support our web product and wasn't designed to communicate business updates.\n\n### Chat is chat, not inbox:\n\nI created a document to explain what that decision meant for the app.\nIf we use the chat sdk, then in the future as other teams build on the chat platform, we should plan to group all kinds of chat in a single space. This would align with the mental model of the user. This space would be the go-to place to follow up on your \"conversations\", whether its about onboarding a new outlet or following up about your GoFresh order.\n\n_Decision:_ We decided that all chats will show up in Inbox but we will need to visually separate them from the business chats. This is something that the Chat team had not yet designed for.\n\n### Where should Inbox/chat go?\n\nGiven that Inbox is something we are considering for communication, it should be easily accessible and indicate unread chats. Given the current structure of the GoBiz app, we could only think of 2 possible positions for the Inbox.\n\nHowever neither of these positions fulfill the conditions of\n\n1. Visibility of new messages: The red dot on Lainnya can't showcase a number since there are several other modules which have a no-number indication.\n\n2. Accessible from various parts of our app: A gofood merchant would jump right to the Orders inbox when they open the app and has no need to aware of this \"notification'\n\n_Decision:_ However without the redesign being prioritized, we decided to keep the entry point on the top right of the 'Lainnya' page.\n\n### Shuffle vs Inbox:\n\n1. Currently there can be overlaps. Overlaps may lead to reduction in importance of Inbox content.\n\n2. Can 'Promo' channel in Inbox be completely replaced by a shuffle card channel on lainnya? because promos need segmentation. Inbox may not work that way.\n\n_Decision:_ No decision yet\n\n### Design iterations\n\nThe Inbox requirement wasn't a new one. 11 months ago, Saneef had worked on how we could introduce communication channels(banner and inbox) in our /existing/ app. [(Aside: His redesign had 'Inbox' as a tab on the bottom navigation)](https://share.goabstract.com/8af61eee-de93-4f63-b0f8-64922742a29e?mode=design&sha=875263ee629f633ddd9229602605e3870884c3da)\n\nWhat was good about this iteration was that latest messages would be visible on the Lainnya page with a way for users to filter different kinds of messages. However this design wouldn't scale well if there were many channels. Think how filters work on Gojek Home's shuffles. Same problem.\n\nWhen we decided to adopt the Chat SDK, it came with a constraint that the view would be a chat window.\n\nSo this constraint causes us to have limited explorations for the channel view. Based on this, here are two iterations that could be possible.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n\nIteration 1 is having a list of channels on the second page, but without the full message so users would need to make an additional click through to get the full message.\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n\nThis exploration attempts to use a notifier informing user about a new message. It could include the text of the message or a generic '1 new message'. In the chat window, we can see the latest message of a channel up front without clicking again to see the message. Even CTAs could be visible here.\n\nSo we went ahead with user-testing with both these iterations, and 'Iteration 2' came out successful.\n\n#### Key Learnings from the research\n\n1. People may ignore the position of the Inbox because of its proximity to the logout button\n\n2. The inbox icon was not understood, so we switched to the envelope icon and called it 'Kotak Pesan'","src/content/projects/gobiz-inbox/index.md","69498e39c9102c32",{"html":327,"metadata":328},"\u003Cp>The Chat SDK was built to support products wanting to integrate chat into their flows.

This would align with the mental model of the user.

During this time, I led and contributed towards the GoBiz app and website, the Spots app and the Midtrans website.\n\n### GoBiz app:\n\nWith the formation of a merchant team in mid 2018, I was the designer tasked with the redesign of the GoBiz app.\n\n#### The objectives of the redesign were\n\n1. **Scalability:** The app was moving from being a food merchant app to a merchant app used by different kinds of merchants. So we needed an information architecture that would work for GoFood, GoPay, and other merchants\n2. **UI refresh:** With the move, we rebranded from Go-Resto to GoBiz and adopted the newly minted Asphalt 1.0 design language system. We were the first app in Gojek to be completely built on the Asphalt design system.\n\n#### Design explorations:\n\n#### User testing:\n\nWe decided to have a pilot group of merchants for the release and the research team conducted a user diary research with them.\n\nAs we had not changed any major flow, we did not find any issues.\n\n#### Learnings post release:\n\nOnce we released we started seeing feedback on the playstore asking us why we had hidden the customer contact. In the design, in the interest of showing the list of ordered items, we had moved the customer contact behind an overflow menu. Our analytics had shown low usage of this feature and we felt we could move it and add an onboarding tooltip for the merchants\n\nHowever these complaints persisted and we followed up with a few merchants to understand the problem. We learned that though the merchants did not end up calling via the app, they would want to see the customer phone number either to collect it for marketing purpose, to call from another number or to identify if its a fraud order.\n\nBased on the feedback, we took a call to re-instate the customer number back on the order details screen.\n\n### GoBiz Dashboard:\n\nSometimes you just inherit a product that has not been loved. The GoBiz dashboard was built for enterprise merchants by forking an internal portal. The portal was built on an internal front end framework \"Tanjidor\" and the designers used to design in the browser and this meant that there were no design files. This meant that there was a dependency on the existing designers. So we decided to pick it up as a design initiative.\n\n#### Objectives of the redesign:\n\n1. Reduce dependancy on the existing designer by\n2. Make the dashboard accessible via mobile web\n\n#### What we did:\n\nIn 2019, we conducted a heuristic evaluation to identify key issues. But post that due to issues with design bandwidth, the project was deprioritised.\n\nFast forward to 2020, Hendri joined us on the GoBiz team and I assigned him to start work on the GoBiz Dashboard redesign as a way to familiarise himself with the product.\n\nWe decided to design anything new with our web design system and not do it in the browser. Due to some luck, the \"platformisation\" of the Dashboard project got prioritised that quarter. However the PM was going to do it without a change to the UI. I convinced her to switch to the new UI. But given the sprint was beginning in 2 weeks, we were short of time. So we got a list of pages to work on a priority basis and started exploring. A lot of work was already done by Hendri however we had to now make the whole site look coherent.\n\n> You can arrive at a different output using the same design system.\n\nWe experimented with spacing and separators, navigation menu designs and modal overlays in the next 10 days to finalise the boilerplate for all the pages. Oh and yeah we also made it responsive.\n\n#### What we could not do:\n\n- [ ] Fix the information architecture issues in every page.\n- [ ] Figure out a table design that works well on mobile and desktop\n\n#### Outcome:\n\nThe GoMart designers were able to use the design system and build their module on the Dashboard with limited dependency on our team.\n\n### The Spots app:\n\nThe SPOTS app was a point of sales app on a Landi device. We were selling these to offline merchants to let them collect payment via offline modes like credit card, debit card and QR.\n\nThe app they were using was a reskinned version of the default app provided by Landi(image on the left).\n\nI was asked to help out with it and I worked on a refresh for the app on a short timeline(image on the right)\n\nWe later integrated this into the POS application on the GoBiz app.\n\n### Midtrans:\n\nIn 2020, the Midtrans merchant onboarding was prioritized due to an external collaboration with Whatsapp.\n\nGiven the urgency, I decided to ask Riyadhi to help the team with the wireframes. Riyadhi had previously worked on the merchant onboarding flow for the GoBiz app and I felt this would help us speed up the process.\n\nWe had just completed the platformization exercise so Hendri and Firman were proficient with the new design system. The dev team too was confident that using the web design system was the best decision. This also made the flow mobile web compatible which was one of the identified merchant pain points.\n\nSo we shipped the new onboarding and saw lot of reduction in the drop offs.\n\n#### Outcome:\n\nThis project exposed most of the team to the 'merchant onboarding' problem space and a surprising side-effect of this was that project handover of the 'corporate onboarding' project could be handled by Hendri when Riyadhi was affected by Covid-19.\n\n#### Miscellaneous:\n\nI consulted on the GoBiz and the Midtrans marketing website.","src/content/projects/gojek/index.md","0c06a24ca3d2544a",{"html":366,"metadata":367},"\u003Cp>From the last 3 years, I worked on the merchant side of Gojek.

Ray had been the mainstay app for most of\nPracto’s existence, while Profile was created to onboard doctors easily to the marketplace. The Qikwell\napp entered into this mix when we acquired their company earlier in 2015. Maintaining 3 separate\nmobile applications was an overhead for our internal teams as well as for our users. Thus **Project\nSingularity** was born.\n\n## Understanding the problem\nI was not involved in the user research phase of this project. I started work on this project at the\nconceptualisation stage. I worked with Jonathan during this phase. The three apps had different visual\nstyles and interactions and were structured as per their workflows. We needed to integrate these\ntogether without alienating their existing user base while also providing a scalable structure for the\nfuture.\n\n>Our vision was to build one app which needs to become the defacto app for doctors and eventually\nother provider segments\n\nBased on the research conducted, it was understood that a healthcare professional had the following\nneeds; Reputation, Productivity, Marketing, Money and Networking.\n\n[Personas for the unified app]\n\nThe new application had to cater to these needs if it had to be a central point of their life. However,\nthese needs vary as per the standing of the doctor. For e.g., a just graduated doctor would seek to\nlearn more from experienced doctors and would rarely have their own clinic while a doctor with 10\nyears of experience would be focussing on setting up her own business and getting more patients.\nFirst we needed to figure out the information architecture. We started putting all the existing parts\nof the various apps into an excel sheet to get an idea of what the pieces were and we also listed out\nfeatures that we felt could be integrated into the app at a later stage.\n\n[arriving at the information architecture]\n\nWe then started organising this based on how the users would be interacting with them. This is when\nwe started realising that some features seemed redundant while others were incomplete. We then\nlooked at how these various features would be impacted with respect to our user roles.\nWe looked at what are the requirements for a user to access our products as well as how the app\nwould be for users of any of the apps. Thus we were able to finalise the information architecture of the app.\n\n[final information architecture]\n\n## Concepts\nBased on this information architecture, I created few app concepts which we evaluated before\nfinalising on the one we would present to the stakeholders. The final concept was presented as an\nInVision prototype.\n\n[final information architecture]\n\nNotifications, Summary and Settings were concepts that we proposed as part of the new app.\n\n**Notifications:**\nAt that point of time, we did not have a single in-product channel of communication. Most\ncommunication happened either by emails, message bars or blocking dialogs. We wanted to change\nthis so we proposed a Notification Drawer. Further, we categorised as notifications as promotional and\ntransactional and provided users with a way to customise what kind of notifications they would like to\nreceive.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe Summary section was conceived as the newsfeed that would be the landing page for returning\nusers to jump directly into their workflow. It was comprised of stationary widgets and a refreshing\ninfinite newsfeed. The widgets were devised only for transactional products like Ray and Consult. The\nrest of the feed was to be powered by content from our other products like Healthfeed, Synapse and\nConsult.\n\n**Settings:**\nJust like notifications, this did not exist but was an obvious thing to build. We didn't want the user to\nexperience the internal product separations that existed.\nThere were many many meetings and back and forth before we could get everyone to agree that this\nwas the way we should go ahead. During the final discussion with the stakeholders, It was decided\nthat the workflow based structure was too futuristic and we would need to have an interface that lets\nour users understand our offerings. So we shifted to an app grid and widget landing as shown below\ninstead of a feed based landing.\n[final app navigation]\n\n## Detailing\nI led this effort with a team of 3 other designers. Hetang, Akshay and me worked to create the various\nproduct screens while Saloni was responsible for the theme and illustrations.

The economics of sending it to the buyer isn't economically viable for such a small quantity when you factor in labour cost & transport cost.

The concept of middlemen have always existed in agricultural systems. What was different was the concept of a single entity who's presence across provinces helped get better prices. \nOur Collectors earned commission for selling through us and our Farmers got the best price. \n\nBut the question remained.. **could we do even better?** and that's where Jiva Lite came in.\n\n\n## Challenge\n\n- One of the reasons we resorted to the micro-collector model was the technical literacy and mobile device penetration in rural Indonesia. Most farmers still used feature phones and many families just had a shared single device usually operated by the children or the wife. For those who did have a smartphone device, local storage and internet were critical constraints. \nIt didn't make sense for them to keep our apps on their phones across seasons and our churn data suggested that as well.\n\n- Our research had shown us that the Sahabat Jiva android app was a complex system compared to the real world way to buying and selling corn\n\n- From the business side, this meant our customer acqusition funnel was fairly expensive and with the commissions and price fluctuations of the market, the Gross Contribution (GC) that we earned per kg was far below what we wanted to be at.\n\n## Role\nMy role was a fluid one in the project where at the start I was leading the product design effort and managing stakeholders but eventually transitioned to co-owning the project and focusing on the digital marketing efforts over the 1 year of operation. \n\n## Solution\n\n![Early Jiva Lite app wireframes](lite-wire.png \"Early Jiva Lite app wireframes\")\n\nThe first idea for Jiva Lite came out of our efforts to simplify the Sahabat Jiva App information architecture and workflows. But it took a few more months before we got a chance to try to solve this.\nThe overwhelming idea at that time was to make another app albeit a \"lite\" one. But a few of us felt that Whatsapp was the way to go. So I used Landbot to quickly prototype how a Whatsapp based flow would look like.\n\n#### Why Whatsapp? \nMeta has deep penetration in Indonesia. Indonesia doesnt have net neutrality laws and hence Meta, Google, Netflix, etc have mobile plans that enabled unlimited usage of their services. \nThis is one of the reason that Facebook and Whatsapp are the communication tool of choice in our users. This meant that \nwe could be assured that unlike a mobile app, our target audience would definitely have Whatsapp on their phones.\n\nAfter pitching this to leadership, we got buyin to use the Whatsapp flow as a pilot project to test out the viability of the Jiva Lite business model.\n\n#### Why was Jiva Lite different?\n- If Jiva Lite had to succeed then it should be economically viable while at the same time, it should not cannibalize our existing businesses. So the pricing logic we set was to keep our offering price at 100idr/kg less than the price we showed in our Sahabat Jiva app. \n- A recent tax exemption made it easy for us to operate at the small scale without needing unnecessary documentation like KTPs\n- For the first time (probably), small holders could sell direct to our buyers irrespective of the volume of their harvest and get paid within a few hours.\n- Meta Ads and Whatsapp QRs let users quickly get into our flow and check prices.\n\n### Building the MVP\nA small team got together to work on this part time. Designing the first flow to be as simple took a few iterations. We used Figma and FigJam a lot to align everyone and used Slack's inbuilt project management system to keep us on track.\nWeekly syncs were run to share progress with the larger group of stakeholders and monthly meetings with the CEO.\n\n![Figjam](./figjam.png \"Blueprinting\")\n\nOur first version was built using Whatsapp Flows and simplified the crop buying flow to just 3 steps; View Prices, Register and Send Truck. \nWe offered farmers the option of selecting between 3 feedmills based on their corn quality. Prices would be updated everyday.\n\n![Designs for the first release version on Figma](./jivalitev1.png \"Designs for the first release version on Figma\")\n\n### Preparing for Go-To-Market\n\n**Onboarding internal teams:**\nWe ran sessions with our field agents, customer service agents and marketing teams to onboard them onto the pilot project. I prepared an \"objection handling\" (a FAQ document) for CX team to use for answering any queries they may receive on their channels.\nSpeaking to our on-ground field agents helped us address their concerns about Jiva Lite and its impact on their operations.\n\n**Selecting a region for piloting:**\nWe had to negotiate with stakeholders for selecting regions due to concerns around our existing micro-collector density as well as time of the year and , we decided to go with the regencies closest to Makassar (South Sulawesi) ; Maros and Takalar. \nThis meant that the distances to be travelled by the farmers to our buyers were just a few hours away.\n\n**On field marketing:**\nWe got 1 field marketer, Erwin, on loan from the growth team for the efforts on on-ground canvassing by meeting farmer groups (Gapoktans).\n\n**Website:**\nWe built a website so that we could provide a social proof that Jiva Lite was infact an offering from Jiva and not a scam. The website had prices which we manually updated and directed users to the Whatsapp number.\n\n**Doing things that don't scale:**\nWe didn't build an in-flow way to add a farmer's bank account details. We resorted instead to use a manual system of getting the information from the farmer and getting CX team to add them to the system. This enabled us to ship faster and prevented user error from entering the wrong information. Where possible we pre-filled dummy data (e.g., user address) in the backend because we didnt want to build without valdiating our idea at this stage.\n\n## Post Launch of the MVP\n\n![Karan, Nav, Idul and Erwin meeting Saripuddin and other farmers](./jivalite-ground.png)\n\nWe launched the first version to production on August 7th, but we didnt get our first transaction till Nav, Karan, Idul and Erwin visited Mr. Saripuddin and convinced him to send the corn to our collection centre.\nOn August 23rd, Saripuddin (seen in the cover image) became the first farmer to have sent us the corn directly. That first transaction was the litmus test that our systems failed, however with Karan co-ordinating with Erwin, we somehow managed to pull through.\n\n>“I made over IDR 3,000,000 with my truck! I invite all my friends to send trucks using Jiva Lite.”\n> — Saripuddin\n\nSaripuddin immediately saw the value Jiva Lite brought to him and instantly became our ambassador convincing multiple farmers in his village to send us corn over the year.\nWithin a month, we hit the milestone of 50 MT and started thinking of the next iteration for Jiva Lite.\n\nPersonally, the first transaction was a feeling unlike any other that my body had experienced. That day, I was unable to act rationally because I was completely blown away by the fact that 14 days after release we secured our first farmer and he saw the value we were providing. \nThere was a lot of time and effort that went into reaching this exact point and it felt glorious.\n\n## Learnings from the Pilot\n**Selling breakdown:** we made a simple google sheets template to generate a breakdown that we sent to every farmer which helped them understand how much they were earning and what was the quality of their corn.\n\n**Backend Issues:** We had not handled user creation of churned/deleted users and this is what caused our first transaction to fail. (Murphy's Law, amirite?)\n\n![spiderkaran](./spiderkaran.png)\n\n**Changing behaviour isn't easy:** When farmers are used to dealing with a broken system, 'a too-good to be true' deal like Jiva Lite feels unrealistic. Furthermore, farmers and local buyers tend to have a personal relationship that isnt easy to overcome. At the end of the day, Jiva is an external entity while the buyer may be a neighbour, a relative or their money lender.\n\n**Flow still complex:** Without our on-field agents, getting users to navigate Whatsapp Flows wasnt easy. Whatsapp flows may seem simple to us, but for our target users, they were complex. We realized that just because they used Facebook and Whatsapp didn't mean that they were familiar navigating similar interfaces. We needed to re-do our flow.\n\n## Building V2\n\nFrom a product point of view, we realised the following shortcomings:\n- The current implementation didn't enable us to A/B test our flow fast enough. \n- There was no way for us to intervene in the flow to guide users through it if required\n- There was no way to re-target and engage our users\n\nWe decided to look if any pre-existing solutions would help us solve this. After an evaluation of several Whatsapp business providers, we decided to go ahead with Landbot. We were already familiar with Landbot and it met all the above criteria.\n\n![A small portion of the Landbot flow](./landbot.png)\n\n**Product:** We re-designed the whole flow to be more like a chat-bot conversation as Landbot didnt support Whatsapp flows. This unfortunately took longer than we planned for and we finally released in early January 2025.\n\n**Marketing:** While we built, we went ahead and started Meta Ads and sending Price Update notifications to users in our funnel. We felt the ads themselves may not be efficient at communicating the concept of Jiva Lite so Tyo and Nav created a few marketing videos to help us.\n\n## Post V2\n\n- Once Landbot released interacting with our users in the funnel became easy. Our Research Coordinators stepped in to own the role of helping guide our users through the funnel. They did a wonderful job (outside of their job description) and even converted a few sales purely via chat.\n\n- Our successful pilot had enabled us to get a small budget approved which allowed us to hire a few more Jive Lite Operators (or JLO's as we called them) to do outreach on ground. We also explored using Sentinel satellite data to help our JLOs narrow their canvassing regions to those being harvested.\n\n![Shakti, Abhishek and I travelled to Gorontalo to figure out if we could launch Jiva Lite there](./gorontalo.jpeg)\n\n- We wanted to scale our solution to other regions so we started expanding to Lampung, Sumatra and Central Java and explored building out Jiva Lite for other crops like Rubber. \n\n- We ran A/B tests and simplified our flow futher. Designed different types of ads; static, videos, localized (Bugis and Bahasa Indonesia) and even engaged social media influencers.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\n- Our digital conversion (Ads - Whatsapp)was near 0 throughout the time of operation. We tried a lot of different approaches but weren't able to get any organic sale from the digital channel. \n\n- Almost 98% of our sales came via our JLOs. This meant scaling volume would directly need more feet on ground and that was seen as expensive.\n\n![Some ads we made for recruiting drossers](./dross.png)\n\n- We uncovered certain systemic issues like Farmer debt, Cash payments (to avoid tax), Drossing systems. We attempted to solve Drossing (separating Corn kernels from Cob) by procuring and \nrenting out drossing machines and even built a simple advertising based funnel to acquire potential customers for this service. but we couldn't solve for the others with our budgetary constraints.\n\n- Though I have attempted to write out the project in detail, there is still a lot that I feel I have left out because building a product and running it takes you in so many different directions. You encounter various problems and inefficiencies and don't always end up solving them.\nThe experience takes a lot out of you but in the end, I am glad I got the opportunity to build a product with this level of ownership.\n\n## Impact\nIn the one year of operation, we scaled Jiva Lite from 0 to 600 registered users who sold 4102 MT of corn. With a margin of 100 IDR/kg, we generated around 24k USD of gross contribution (Additional earnings from sales from trading this corn added an additional 200 IDR/kg, which has not been counted here)\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"impact-images\" style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr; gap: 1rem;\">\n\n\n![](./jl-impact-1.png)\n\n![](./jl-impact-2.png)\n\n\u003C/div>\n\nBehaviourally though, we were about to bring meaningful improvements into the lives of the Farmers in a few provinces of South Sulawesi. Most farmers who transacted with us made about 2.5-3 million IDR(~$180 USD) more than they would otherwise.\nEven after Jiva Lite shut down, a few of the farmers continued to deal directly with the collection centres and improve their collective earnings.\n\n## Team\nIt takes a village to run a project like this and almost everyone in the Jiva design team contributed towards this project. I couldnt have done this without Karan owning the offline side, Nilesh running the product sprint and Shakti managing the JLO's. \n\nNav, Sai and Tyo worked on the initial flow designs and Niraj took the reigns towards the end, Kesha on the UX copy, and Karan and Bharath on the Service Design. \nAsa, Idul, Aldi and El contributed heavily on the User research side often intervening in our workflow to helpg guide our Farmers. \nAkshay Koul led the Engineering team with Kalpesh and Mani, Rajlakshmi on QA.

The economics of sending it to the buyer isn’t economically viable for such a small quantity when you factor in labour cost &#x26; transport cost.

But a few of us felt that Whatsapp was the way to go.

Indonesia doesnt have net neutrality laws and hence Meta, Google, Netflix, etc have mobile plans that enabled unlimited usage of their services.\nThis is one of the reason that Facebook and Whatsapp are the communication tool of choice in our users. This meant that\nwe could be assured that unlike a mobile app, our target audience would definitely have Whatsapp on their phones.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After pitching this to leadership, we got buyin to use the Whatsapp flow as a pilot project to test out the viability of the Jiva Lite business model.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"why-was-jiva-lite-different\">Why was Jiva Lite different?\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>If Jiva Lite had to succeed then it should be economically viable while at the same time, it should not cannibalize our existing businesses.
