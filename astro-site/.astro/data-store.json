However like many other platformized products, they end up being looked as solutions for use cases they were not designed for. The GoBiz inbox requirement wasn't my first experience with dog fooding, but it was one that I was able to influence positively for the benefit of the users.\n\nWe wanted to build an Inbox, an in-app channel for notifying our users. We just needed one-way communication. I do not understand the reason behind why product pushed to use the SDK, despite the arguments that the SDK wasn't able to support our web product and wasn't designed to communicate business updates.\n\n### Chat is chat, not inbox:\n\nI created a document to explain what that decision meant for the app.\nIf we use the chat sdk, then in the future as other teams build on the chat platform, we should plan to group all kinds of chat in a single space. This would align with the mental model of the user. This space would be the go-to place to follow up on your \"conversations\", whether its about onboarding a new outlet or following up about your GoFresh order.\n\n_Decision:_ We decided that all chats will show up in Inbox but we will need to visually separate them from the business chats. This is something that the Chat team had not yet designed for.\n\n### Where should Inbox/chat go?\n\nGiven that Inbox is something we are considering for communication, it should be easily accessible and indicate unread chats. Given the current structure of the GoBiz app, we could only think of 2 possible positions for the Inbox.\n\nHowever neither of these positions fulfill the conditions of\n\n1. Visibility of new messages: The red dot on Lainnya can't showcase a number since there are several other modules which have a no-number indication.\n\n2. Accessible from various parts of our app: A gofood merchant would jump right to the Orders inbox when they open the app and has no need to aware of this \"notification'\n\n_Decision:_ However without the redesign being prioritized, we decided to keep the entry point on the top right of the 'Lainnya' page.\n\n### Shuffle vs Inbox:\n\n1. Currently there can be overlaps. Overlaps may lead to reduction in importance of Inbox content.\n\n2. Can 'Promo' channel in Inbox be completely replaced by a shuffle card channel on lainnya? because promos need segmentation. Inbox may not work that way.\n\n_Decision:_ No decision yet\n\n### Design iterations\n\nThe Inbox requirement wasn't a new one. 11 months ago, Saneef had worked on how we could introduce communication channels(banner and inbox) in our /existing/ app. [(Aside: His redesign had 'Inbox' as a tab on the bottom navigation)](https://share.goabstract.com/8af61eee-de93-4f63-b0f8-64922742a29e?mode=design&sha=875263ee629f633ddd9229602605e3870884c3da)\n\nWhat was good about this iteration was that latest messages would be visible on the Lainnya page with a way for users to filter different kinds of messages. However this design wouldn't scale well if there were many channels. Think how filters work on Gojek Home's shuffles. Same problem.\n\nWhen we decided to adopt the Chat SDK, it came with a constraint that the view would be a chat window.\n\nSo this constraint causes us to have limited explorations for the channel view. Based on this, here are two iterations that could be possible.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n\nIteration 1 is having a list of channels on the second page, but without the full message so users would need to make an additional click through to get the full message.\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n\nThis exploration attempts to use a notifier informing user about a new message. It could include the text of the message or a generic '1 new message'. In the chat window, we can see the latest message of a channel up front without clicking again to see the message. Even CTAs could be visible here.\n\nSo we went ahead with user-testing with both these iterations, and 'Iteration 2' came out successful.\n\n#### Key Learnings from the research\n\n1. People may ignore the position of the Inbox because of its proximity to the logout button\n\n2. The inbox icon was not understood, so we switched to the envelope icon and called it 'Kotak Pesan'","src/content/writing/gobiz-inbox/index.md","564aed03676b7a0b",{"html":78,"metadata":79},"\u003Cp>The Chat SDK was built to support products wanting to integrate chat into their flows.

During this time, I've lead and contributed towards the GoBiz app and website, the Spots app and the Midtrans website.\n\n### GoBiz app:\n\nWith the formation of a merchant team in mid 2018, I was the designer tasked with the redesign of the GoBiz app.\n\n#### The objectives of the redesign were\n\n1. **Scalability:** The app was moving from being a food merchant app to a merchant app used by different kinds of merchants. So we needed an information architecture that would work for GoFood, GoPay, and other merchants\n2. **UI refresh:** With the move, we rebranded from Go-Resto to GoBiz and adopted the newly minted Asphalt 1.0 design language system. We were the first app in Gojek to be completely built on the Asphalt design system.\n\n#### Design explorations:\n\n#### User testing:\n\nWe decided to have a pilot group of merchants for the release and the research team conducted a user diary research with them.\n\nAs we had not changed any major flow, we did not find any issues.\n\n#### Learnings post release:\n\nOnce we released we started seeing feedback on the playstore asking us why we had hidden the customer contact. In the design, in the interest of showing the list of ordered items, we had moved the customer contact behind an overflow menu. Our analytics had shown low usage of this feature and we felt we could move it and add an onboarding tooltip for the merchants\n\nHowever these complaints persisted and we followed up with a few merchants to understand the problem. We learned that though the merchants did not end up calling via the app, they would want to see the customer phone number either to collect it for marketing purpose, to call from another number or to identify if its a fraud order.\n\nBased on the feedback, we took a call to re-instate the customer number back on the order details screen.\n\n### GoBiz Dashboard:\n\nSometimes you just inherit a product that has not been loved. The GoBiz dashboard was built for enterprise merchants by forking an internal portal. The portal was built on an internal front end framework \"Tanjidor\" and the designers used to design in the browser and this meant that there were no design files. This meant that there was a dependency on the existing designers. So we decided to pick it up as a design initiative.\n\n#### Objectives of the redesign:\n\n1. Reduce dependancy on the existing designer by\n2. Make the dashboard accessible via mobile web\n\n#### What we did:\n\nIn 2019, we conducted a heuristic evaluation to identify key issues. But post that due to issues with design bandwidth, the project was deprioritised.\n\nFast forward to 2020, Hendri joined us on the GoBiz team and I assigned him to start work on the GoBiz Dashboard redesign as a way to familiarise himself with the product.\n\nWe decided to design anything new with our web design system and not do it in the browser. Due to some luck, the \"platformisation\" of the Dashboard project got prioritised that quarter. However the PM was going to do it without a change to the UI. I convinced her to switch to the new UI. But given the sprint was beginning in 2 weeks, we were short of time. So we got a list of pages to work on a priority basis and started exploring. A lot of work was already done by Hendri however we had to now make the whole site look coherent.\n\n> You can arrive at a different output using the same design system.\n\nWe experimented with spacing and separators, navigation menu designs and modal overlays in the next 10 days to finalise the boilerplate for all the pages. Oh and yeah we also made it responsive.\n\n#### What we could not do:\n\n- [ ] Fix the information architecture issues in every page.\n- [ ] Figure out a table design that works well on mobile and desktop\n\n#### Outcome:\n\nThe GoMart designers were able to use the design system and build their module on the Dashboard with limited dependency on our team.\n\n### The Spots app:\n\nThe SPOTS app was a point of sales app on a Landi device. We were selling these to offline merchants to let them collect payment via offline modes like credit card, debit card and QR.\n\nThe app they were using was a reskinned version of the default app provided by Landi(image on the left).\n\nI was asked to help out with it and I worked on a refresh for the app on a short timeline(image on the right)\n\nWe later integrated this into the POS application on the GoBiz app.\n\n### Midtrans:\n\nIn 2020, the Midtrans merchant onboarding was prioritized due to an external collaboration with Whatsapp.\n\nGiven the urgency, I decided to ask Riyadhi to help the team with the wireframes. Riyadhi had previously worked on the merchant onboarding flow for the GoBiz app and I felt this would help us speed up the process.\n\nWe had just completed the platformization exercise so Hendri and Firman were proficient with the new design system. The dev team too was confident that using the web design system was the best decision. This also made the flow mobile web compatible which was one of the identified merchant pain points.\n\nSo we shipped the new onboarding and saw lot of reduction in the drop offs.\n\n#### Outcome:\n\nThis project exposed most of the team to the 'merchant onboarding' problem space and a surprising side-effect of this was that project handover of the 'corporate onboarding' project could be handled by Hendri when Riyadhi was affected by Covid-19.\n\n#### Miscellaneous:\n\nI consulted on the GoBiz and the Midtrans marketing website.","src/content/writing/gojek/index.md","d69c22f1467ef29d",{"html":120,"metadata":121},"\u003Cp>From the last 3 years, I’ve been working on the merchant side of Gojek.

I was lucky to be part of an organization that had a documentation culture in its DNA. This was partly because we had Program Managers embedded within each team. This meant that Jira, Confluence and Asana were setup and maintained religiously, with weekly feature spec reviews [FSR] and ProdTech meetings to keep these upto date.\n\n### Setting up Documentation spaces\n\nI find design documentation to be critical part of the design process. I recommend every designer takes the time to document the project because apart from being a design artifact, that serves as a single point of truth, it also helps them when they have to write their performance reviews, promotion proposals and build their portfolio.\n\nI do not like Google Docs for documentation. Documentation spaces need to be a searchable wiki and ironically Google Docs is poor at providing this. At Practo, we already had Atlassian's Confluence setup when I joined, and at Gojek, Maji setup our Confluence spaces in 2019 and then the two of us started structuring and documenting our knowledge about the product and its processes. I created a design documentation template based on the product feature spec template and advocated for it.\n\nAs for project management, the org moved to using Asana. Adding them here felt forced and an unnecessary addition to our workload. However as our product roadmap was moved into Asana, I devised a process to make design tasks a visible part of the product development process by adding them as subtasks and duplicating them to our design boards for effective tracking. Post every prioritization meeting, I added tasks into the todo list and tagged designers so that they were aware of what's coming up.\n\nHowever, we faced a problem with adoption of these processes. We lacked a program manager dedicated to design and not all designers in the team were able to keep their boards updated. We were able to setup a biweekly cadence with the program management VP, Gifika, to discuss our problems and understand how we can get better at solving them. And what we learned is two things.\n\n1.

I was lucky to be part of an organization that had a documentation culture in its DNA. This was partly because we had Program Managers embedded within each team.

Adding them here felt forced and an unnecessary addition to our workload. However as our product roadmap was moved into Asana, I devised a process to make design tasks a visible part of the product development process by adding them as subtasks and duplicating them to our design boards for effective tracking. Post every prioritization meeting, I added tasks into the todo list and tagged designers so that they were aware of what’s coming up.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, we faced a problem with adoption of these processes. We lacked a program manager dedicated to design and not all designers in the team were able to keep their boards updated.

What is your role?\n\nKnowing why they opened the designer role is important before you take that job. I recommend that you ask the hiring manager this question during your interview rounds and also ask to speak to the critical members in the team you will be joining. I take it that most Founders open a position because they got some feedback from customers or because their investor told them to. They may not be ready to invest in what can make a designer effective in their role.\n\n### 2. Fitting into the team:\n\nThe team would need to adapt to having an in-house designer working with them. The team members would need to understand what the role of the designer is and how they could work with them. They would need to take time to adapt their workflows or create new inclusive processes. All this is hard to do and the designer(especially a junior one) wouldn’t do very well without a sponsor.\n\n### 3. You need a sponsor.\n\nOne of my key learnings has been to choose to work with someone who will be your advocate in the organisation.

The adoption of using it for software designers got a shot in the arm when [Facebook adopted it](https://qr.ae/pGQdVi) for their designers. Until then UI/UX was the term of choice for folks in the industry and used to indicate a specific job that the designer performed in the team. This was indicative of the shift from the delivery teams working with client requirements (enterprise first) to product teams (rapidly iterating consumer tech) which had to learn and uncover what was the best product they could build. Due to the scarcity of product designers in the space, companies started acquiring design agencies around the world \\[1\\].\n\nThe ‘product designer’ now had to start looking at what they are designing as a product and not be restricted by your traditional mindset of UI and UX responsibilities. This would mean that they would need to learn about business, uncover user insights, use data analytic tools, have technical understanding, etc to design their product. These aren’t skills that come naturally to designers and there-in lay the problem. Not every designer wanted to be a “product designer” but it was an aspirational job for designers given the pay packages were miles ahead of what designers were paid in other industries. More and more companies started adopting the term of ‘product designer’ to follow industry trends and attract talent.\n\nBut even then there were few orgs which took design seriously.\n\n![Source: 2014 interview in Dezeen [2]](./product-designer-1.png)\n\nEven today, most orgs don’t really provide a space for designers to thrive in the product space and even today, there are probably a handful of product designers and product orgs in the world, the rest is mostly good PR.\n\nAnd what are the aspects of a product designer that sets them apart from other designers?\n\n### Quality\n\nThe primary aspect the product designer optimises for is quality of delivery. Quality being subjective makes it hard for the different disciplines to align over what this means. For me, it means that the product designer needs to understand the constraints of business and development to be able to deliver the best outcome possible in the defined timeline. You may want to build that perfect animated transition, but let’s be real, that’s not really a user need most of the time. The product’s usage and success should be the thing driving you towards excelling as a designer.\n\n![](./product-designer-2.jpg)\n\n### Curiosity\n\nJust like Alice, a product designer has to be inquisitive about their users and their behaviour and the systems they inhabit. The ‘product designer’ need to be comfortable looking at dashboards, analyzing events as well as drafting a research plan and talking to users. The best way to level up as a product designer is to learn from what you are building and putting out into the world. And this learning tends to compound as the years go by and helps you take decisions when faced with new design challenges.\n\n### Craft\n\nThe product designer is actually [T-shaped](https://spotify.design/article/finding-your-t-shape-as-a-generalist-designer) despite a lot of folks thinking that they are generalists. So although the industry largely refers to the visual polish as ‘craft’, I don’t feel its restricted to just that. You could be a ‘product designer’ excelling at copy writing, or a ‘product designer’ inclined towards the code side. A good team is made of many such designers who can learn from each other. If every designer you hire (or in your team) has a similar skill set to you then there would be limited direction for you to grow in. Some teams out there have chosen to double down on this kind of team building but to me that’s building a design specialist team.\n\n### Agency\n\nThis is a quality which is rare to find. I feel this is because most designers tend to be introverts and love to be comfortable in their “space”. It’s easy to spend time in the world making pixel perfection your entire personality, it’s not easy to go out on a limb and argue for a decision to be made. Unfortunately, agency is what helps you level up the ranks. Agency is what gets you a seat at the table. Another hurdle towards product designers developing agency is that they need to be part of good teams run by design leaders who support and sponsor you and those are really scarce in supply.\n\n### So where do we go from here?\n\n* I see that we need to address this at a system level, today the ‘product design’ comes with a better salary and so for designers to get better pay it’s better to call themselves Product Designers. So things can’t change until the hiring parties don’t get better at their jobs.\n\n* No one designer is the same as the other. Organisations should be cognizant that there are no such thing as generalists and design their career rubrics in a way to suit the different kinds of designers on their team. This helps each designer to grow in their own way within the org.\n\n* Job descriptions could be honest up front of the kind of designer that they are looking for rather than getting ChatGPT to write it. There is no point lying about this, infact it just takes you lot longer to find someone.\n\n**Footnote:**\n\n1. **John Maeda's Design in Tech report 2015, Slide 4** https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/design-in-tech-report-2015-45858974/45858974\n2. **Silicon Valley \"didn't think a designer could build a company\" says Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky** https://www.dezeen.com/2014/01/28/silicon-valley-didnt-think-a-designer-could-build-a-company-interview-airbnb-co-founder-brian-chesky/\n3. **Pablo Stanley, Collection of Random Comics** https://thedesignteam.io/collection-of-random-comics-d66f32ee9c52\n4.

In fact, there are a lot of highly [priced](https://maven.com/rachel-kobetz/dls-career-architecture) [leadership](https://www.designdept.co/series/design-leadership-fundamentals) [training](https://www.aiga.org/design/design-leadership) courses out there these days.\n\nOver my career of 10 odd years, I’ve had the honour of being an observer in the product design industry of 2 countries; India and Indonesia. My perspective comes from my vantage point of living in the Silicon Valley of India and professionally, from being part of the growth stage of the well funded startups.\n\nFor this article(rant?), I will use Startups vs Big Tech for sake of categorisation. Big tech would have the minimum expectation of being a listed company operating across more than 1 geographical region. Meta and the other MAANG companies would fall into big tech but do remember that they are the new entrants in a space already filled by CISCO, Intuit, Adobe.\n\nPost the dot-com bust, we saw the slow rise of today’s modern digital startups. First in the Silicon Valley and then in the rest of the world. This was mainly fuelled by the VC funding and still is. This lead us to look up to the Silicon Valley companies and the folks there as thought leaders for design. And rightly so since they were working on products we admired and used half a world away. That scale and magnitude is definitely something to be proud of. They encountered and solved problems at scale, establishing standards, registering patents and forming user behaviours that we take for granted today\n\nBut in our part of the world, even today, digital product design is still attempting to break out of its UI and UX tags. When I started out in 2014, UI/UX was the predominant way of describing designers in big tech, and even startups. Of course there were exceptions, but I will ignore them as outliers. The startup I worked at back then, was one of the first in India to adopt Facebook’s popular convention to start using the term ‘Product Designer’. Back then, the Indian digital design industry was so small. You were separated by 1-2 degrees from everyone and arguably, it’s still that small. The VC funding however gave rise to a notion that tech startups are a lucrative career compared to the dominant IT/ITES industry. This led to a gold rush fuelled by opportunistic bootcamps and certification courses, most of which churned out low skill designers. However, unlike the West, few companies thrived and hardly any have scaled and now we have a supply-demand problem at hand.\n\nThis leads us to where we are today:\n\n1. Local companies are not getting ‘Big’ enough or if they are, once they get listed, they need to justify costs and respond to the market. It’s quite easy for decision makers to take that call and cut a few roles to keep costs in check. Easier than getting out of your software license contracts to cut costs. Also much easier to do this when others in the industry are also doing layoffs. Smaller companies imply that there are fewer senior roles to be filled especially when most teams out there are feature factories who know what to build next.\n\n2. In my experience, Design leaders in startups have always been expected to play a dual role of designer + manager. Infact the designer aspect is valued a lot more while the manager title is granted to keep designers happy. That said, Most companies do not know what to do with the design leaders that they hire. So often, what you encounter is the Design Leader who is a figurehead to appease the junior designers with almost 0 influence on business outcomes or worst case, to be head of design of a design team of 1. This explains the short tenures because those roles are just not fulfilling.\n\n3. This may anger a few, but in the current state of the industry, design progression ladders don’t need an IC track beyond the level of a senior designer of 5-6 years of experience. If you are not a Meta/Google, I don’t expect there to be scope or complexity that needs Staff Designers. So where have these senior designers been going? Well some of them move into “Manager” roles without the skills to operate in them while others tend to move out of the country to join companies which may have grown to a larger size or worst case at least they get to experience a new culture.\n\n4. The skills you need as a manager are different from the ones you polished as an IC designer. Being good at Figma can only take you so far, if you don’t have an affinity for bureaucracy, then being a manager is a bad fit. On the other extreme are the managers and heads of design, usually from a background in older big tech companies, who were at positions where their job was to pontificate about design and innovation. These folk tend to be disconnected from the day-to-day work and that’s bad for the team as well. Both of these are highly replaceable roles.\n\n5. And finally, we have not moved away from the worker productivity categorisation of industrialisation. Bell curves are common, business wants to keep control and budgets are paramount. I would like to argue that Design never got a seat at the table. The “Design Thinking” hype that got thrown around by IBM, McKinsey, IDEO was for their own PR and has run its due course. Everyone likes an optimistic story but rarely would you find actual organisation leaders(CXOs) believing in the value that Design brings to the business and actually investing into Design. That is as true today, as it was a decade ago and hence good fulfilling design jobs are few and far between. \\\n   \\\n   This does not paint a very rosy picture of today's design industry but after all these years, this is my honest take on the state of affairs.
