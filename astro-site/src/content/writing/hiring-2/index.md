Over the last 2 months, I’ve been involved in building the product design team at Jiva. I’ve never had the opportunity to build a team from scratch and it felt scary at first. We had no defined process nor an evaluation criteria, just a product designer job description. It was well structured job description and spoke to the generalist designers we wanted to recruit but we were aware we needed to scale.

There are lot of opinions out there about hiring, Many prefer visual portfolios, others vouch for take home assignments and a few years back, co-working sessions have started to get popular. None of these are actually wrong, they are just a reflection of the organisation that you are hiring for. It’s also the first hand experience of the team’s culture that the designer you are hiring will undergo and therefore designing it becomes important. 

>Hiring visual designers is good if your product team calls the shot on the flows, hiring take home assignments is great the communication skills of someone, while working in tandem helps you understand how it would be to work with the person on your team.

Today’s design team needs to be multi-faceted. Based on your organization’s competencies, you can create a spider chart visualization of your team.

[what is the spider chart of your organization?]

As a hiring manager, you need to learn how to balance this web of skills with the products you are building for and every designer you hire adds to the team additively rather than multiplicatively. 

It’s also called a team for a reason, the product you are building needs to feel seamless to the end user and not a product of many different skillsets. Getting people to play well together is therefore an unstated rule of good deisgn teams. 


If you have too many designers who are illustrators, you still need a common design style that shouldnt be tied to any single designer. (Ai tools claim to make that simpler these days)

> When you are managing multiple large teams, this becomes way more important. [small multiples] 

What’s missing in this visualization is the ‘culture-fit’ of the designer you are evaluating,
