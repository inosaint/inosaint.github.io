There are lot of opinions out there about hiring. When I wrote [Part 1](https://kenneth.dsouza.im/writing/hiring/), I was an experienced Interview Panelist for product design and product management. Part 2, are my reflections 
after being in the role of the hiring manager and designing the hiring process.

**1. Your hiring process is a reflection of your Culture:**
If you see job descriptions these days, many explicitly ask for visual portfolios, others vouch for take home assignments and a few years back, co-working and whiteboarding sessions started to getting popular.
What you choose to include in your hiring process is the reflection of your organisation and its culture. You are designing the "first time" experience of the designer to your team’s culture.

Each of the above choices communicates something to the prospective candidate. Hiring visual designers is good if your product team calls the shot on the flows and what you need is focus on user experience, hiring take home assignments is great if you want to evaluate the communication skills of someone, 
while working in tandem helps you understand how it would be to work with the person on your team. None of these are wrong in themselves. However if there's a mismatch between the process and the way of working, then you have a problem. 
For e.g., I've heard of hiring managers looking for visual designers but don't want them to be "visual" after they are hired.
There is absolutely no reason to add certain rounds just because every one else is. (You can read about how we approached this at Jiva here)

**2. Today’s design team needs to be multi-faceted:**
When I first started being involved in hiring, my evaluation aspect always tended to favour a certain kind of product designer. It did make sense when every designer had their own product to deal with
but failed when they had to work together as the org matured. What I would suggest now is to take time and visualize your team's skillsets. One way of
doing this is to use your org's design competencies and create a rough spider chart of your team and it's members. 
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

[what is the spider chart of your organization?]
> When you are managing multiple large teams, this becomes way more important. [small multiples] 

This visualization helps you to learn what your team's strengths and weaknesses are and how you can balance them with hiring. 
For e.g., You could balance a more visual designer with a more analytical one to balance out the product's capabilities.

**3.There is no place for ego in the team**
It’s also called a design "team" for a reason, the product you are building needs to feel seamless to the end user and not a product of many different personalities.
What’s missing in the above spider chart visualization is the ‘culture-fit’ of the designer you are evaluating, 

Getting people to "play well" together is an under-stated rule of good design teams. You need designers who want to collaborate and work with the other disciplines to ship a quality product.
Hiring superstars is a recipe for failure. Just because a designer(or engineer, pm, etc for that matter) is able to wow 
you with their skills does not mean that they are a good hire. Using your team members to do a vibe check would help you prevent a bad hire down the line.
