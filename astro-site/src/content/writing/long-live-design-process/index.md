I’ve been building with AI for the past few months and I dont think the design process is dead.

Over the last couple of decades, the design process had been tamed and commoditised into a nice and neat palatable package, especially in the software startup world. If you look around at designer portfolios, they are filled with a templatic story of research, personas, wireframes and final output[1]. (another thing that most of this is manufactured to appease the hiring manager gods).  This *isn't* what the design process is, but I can understand why it might feel that way.. 

Especially because you are building from air-conditioned rooms in the urban workspaces and not

The design process was and is really about building iteratively. The design sprint tried to bring that back but I don’t think people noticed. It's far easier to look at competitors, or favour your own bias, than go out talk to users, understand your product’s data and figure out what you really need. Plus talking to real users is expensive and time consuming so very few teams invest in this. 



“Some people might say that “taste is a new core skill” but it’s really more about caring for what you’re building and why.” - Agu Segui, Paper.design

There are two key things to keep in mind when building using AI today:





AI seems to work as an amplifier of your skills and knowledge. The outcome from AI tools is far superior from someone who has a broader understanding of the problem space and domain compared to a regular individual.



Designing directly with AI leads to the same pitfalls as the designing in the browser did.





Seeing AI generate the artifact can cause designers to fixate on the way they see the solution. E.g, In a recent project, I spent a lot of time trying to stick to the structure that the AI created before realizing that I wasn’t looking at the bigger picture and had to scrap days of work.



While the argument against designing in the browser was becuase you end up being limited by your own skillset to manipulate css. In AI’s terms, it’s about knowing how to prompt to get the outcomes you need. There is tooling (and workarounds) now that helps to some extent but the canvas is still the superior way to design.



LLM Models are not infallible (at the point of writing). Knowing when to switch between different models is key skill to develop. Specialized models exist and they can help you get better outcomes.



"Design fixation is a well-documented cognitive bias where a designer becomes stuck on a limited set of ideas, often influenced by prior knowledge, previous solutions, or dominant trends," explains design psychology expert Rachel A. Wood.

but really building and designing is about getting your product in the hands of your users and learning from their interactions. at jiva, we leveraged service design in our systems to map our ecosystems and test out scrappy prototypes in the real world to validate the idea before we took the product team’s time. the prototypes we built could have been run on whatsapp, on excel sheets or using glide. if they didn’t work, we would go back and iterate on them. 

Yes, but the prototypes didn’t mean a short cut, we still spent hours making archetypes, filled miro boards full of research, and made presentations to stakeholders. Because you aren’t the only one in the organisation who needs to know what’s happening. These artifacts were never only for the designers, but for the non-designers who needed to be explained why this solution, and how this solution would impact the product and illustrate possible outcomes.

What AI can help with is to speed up such artifact creation, like synthesizing and transcribing research calls and videos, generating ecosystem maps based on the data, helping create archetypes and ofcourse faster iterations on the prototypes.
