## Overview

The Akar Design System was built to create consistency across Jiva's agricultural technology platform, enabling faster development and better user experiences for farmers and agricultural stakeholders.

## Challenge

As Jiva's product ecosystem expanded, we needed a unified design language that could scale across multiple applications while maintaining consistency and efficiency.

### What we needed to solve:

**Scalable:** Lay the foundation for Jiva to scale across platforms and countries

**Speed:** Designers had to hunt for colors/components across multiple Figma files

**Output Quality:** Better handoff process to ensure that what's designed gets developed

**Accessibility:** The fonts and colors used in the older app was not compliant with the minimum WCAG guidelines

**Standardization:** A feel of coherence across the product

## Solution

We developed a comprehensive design system that included:

- Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, toggles, navigation)
- Consistent color schemes and typography
- Responsive layout patterns
- Accessibility guidelines
- Component documentation

## Impact

The Akar Design System enabled our teams to build faster, maintain consistency across products, and deliver better experiences to our users in rural Indonesia.
