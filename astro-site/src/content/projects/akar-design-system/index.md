Design systems often represent an aspirational milestone for product design teams. But they’re often seen as an all-or-nothing project — something that takes months of planning and effort, 
while day-to-day product delivery suffers. When everything is moving at breakneck speed, it feels risky to divert resources into building a design system. 
**But is it really?**

In early 2022, Jiva was deep in the throes of hyper-growth, onboarding new team members almost every week. The chaos hit every part of the company, and the design team wasn’t immune. 
Work was being duplicated across pods, our user experience was inconsistent, accessibility needs were being overlooked, and our app’s 
performance was lagging behind.
At the time, we had a Figma-style guide, but it simply wasn’t enough. We needed more than a set of visual guidelines — we needed a 
comprehensive design system that could help us keep up with the rapid growth without adding friction to the process. And yet, we faced a tough constraint: 
our design team was tiny (and growing), so we had to approach this in a _lean_ way.

## Challenge

As Jiva's product ecosystem expanded, we needed a unified design language that could scale across multiple applications while maintaining consistency and efficiency.

### What we needed to solve:

**Scalable:** Lay the foundation for Jiva to scale across platforms and countries

**Speed:** Designers had to hunt for colors/components across multiple Figma files

**Output Quality:** Better handoff process to ensure that what's designed gets developed

**Accessibility:** The fonts and colors used in the older app was not compliant with the minimum WCAG guidelines

**Standardization:** A feel of coherence across the product

## Solution

We developed a comprehensive design system that included:

- Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, toggles, navigation)
- Consistent color schemes and typography
- Responsive layout patterns
- Accessibility guidelines
- Component documentation

## Impact

The Akar Design System enabled our teams to build faster, maintain consistency across products, and deliver better experiences to our users in rural Indonesia.
