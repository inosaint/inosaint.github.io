## Overview

The Akar Design System was built to create consistency across Jiva's agricultural technology platform, enabling faster development and better user experiences for farmers and agricultural stakeholders.

## Challenge

As Jiva's product ecosystem expanded, we needed a unified design language that could scale across multiple applications while maintaining consistency and efficiency.

## Solution

We developed a comprehensive design system that included:

- Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, toggles, navigation)
- Consistent color schemes and typography
- Responsive layout patterns
- Accessibility guidelines
- Component documentation

## Impact

The Akar Design System enabled our teams to build faster, maintain consistency across products, and deliver better experiences to our users in rural Indonesia.
