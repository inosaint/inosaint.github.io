When I joined Jiva in January of 2022, as the Senior Design Manager of Product Design, we were a team of 2; me and Sai. We had to start building a team. I’ve never had the opportunity to build a team from scratch and it felt scary at first.
We had no defined process nor an evaluation criteria, just a product designer job description. It was well structured job description and spoke to the generalist designers we wanted to recruit but we were aware we needed to scale.

So with Nav's guidance, we designed a simple hiring flow keeping the good part of the older scrappy process while being mindful about the candidates and their time. 

Our process therefore was quite simple; 

### Round 0: Shortlisting Candidates
With our job description posted, we looked for candidates and their submissions to shortlist the ones we wanted to speak to. When Jiva was less known, we barely had any interested candidates and shortlisting was very easy. 
But for the last set of job openings, we had a lot of demand making it impossible to screen effieciently. We encouraged people to send us Cover letters while applying rather than applying via the portal.
This acted as a fairly effective screening condition as not many ended up emailing us.

### Round 1: Screening Call
This is the first experience a candidate has of Jiva’s design team and we want it to be the best.
We want to make the candidate comfortable and help them understand what Jiva is and what working here would be like.
This was the round where we discussed compensation in brief so that we could set expectations both upstream (with HR and leadership) and downstream (with the candidate).
The hiring manager (i.e., me) was the best person to have this conversation with the candidate.

For a candidate to make it through, they just needed to feel like they knew how to design, work in the team and someone I would want to have on my team.
The folks who blew my mind in this round inadvertently went to be key members of the team and probably the best skilled designers I've worked with.

### Round 2: Presentation Round
Since we were a small team with a short candidate pipeline, we didn't see value in having take home assignments or whiteboarding sessions, instead we opted for the presentation round. The jury for this round was composed
of the other designers. We designed the jury based on the candidate. There would be a cultural mix of nationalities, genders and design disciplines in every jury panel. What we mainly measured in this round was
the capabilities of a product designer, (eventually we used our Job levels for this evaluation) and how they vibed with the jury panel. It wasn't enough that you had good work, you needed
to fit in. Controversial maybe? but I felt strongly that getting people to play well together is key to building good design teams. In time, I've come to realize that just because you have technical chops
doesn't make you a good product designer. You also need to be kind, empathetic and collaborative. Technical skills can be learned, these values can not.

If you made it past this round, "Congrats, welcome to the Jiva design team" 🙌🏽

For everyone we rejected in Round 2, I tried to send a personal email to them explaining why they didn't make it. But this was hard to follow 100% of the time and I'm sure I forgot to send a few.

### Round 3(?): Stakeholder Round
For L3 (our highest IC level) hiring, we added an extra round. 
This was a chat with a Lead product manager to help gauge how the designer would fit within the Product and their product thinking abilities.
These designers would function like leads and own design for their product vertical. 

### Round 4: HR Round
There was a final round(or two) where either Nav or HR would have a conversation with the employee and dealt with the technicalities around compensation and hiring policies.

In time, we grew the team to 11 product designers working on 5+ mobile and web apps across multiple business systems (farmer, collector, retailer).
