## Overview
Around Dec 2015, Practo had 3 mobile apps (Profile, Ray and Qikwell Pulse), each of which served a
particular purpose and worked independent of each other. Ray had been the mainstay app for most of
Practo’s existence, while Profile was created to onboard doctors easily to the marketplace. The Qikwell
app entered into this mix when we acquired their company earlier in 2015. Maintaining 3 separate
mobile applications was an overhead for our internal teams as well as for our users. Thus **Project
Singularity** was born.

## Understanding the problem
I was not involved in the user research phase of this project. I started work on this project at the
conceptualisation stage. I worked with Jonathan during this phase. The three apps had different visual
styles and interactions and were structured as per their workflows. We needed to integrate these
together without alienating their existing user base while also providing a scalable structure for the
future.

>Our vision was to build one app which needs to become the defacto app for doctors and eventually
other provider segments

Based on the research conducted, it was understood that a healthcare professional had the following
needs; Reputation, Productivity, Marketing, Money and Networking.

[Personas for the unified app]

The new application had to cater to these needs if it had to be a central point of their life. However,
these needs vary as per the standing of the doctor. For e.g., a just graduated doctor would seek to
learn more from experienced doctors and would rarely have their own clinic while a doctor with 10
years of experience would be focussing on setting up her own business and getting more patients.
First we needed to figure out the information architecture. We started putting all the existing parts
of the various apps into an excel sheet to get an idea of what the pieces were and we also listed out
features that we felt could be integrated into the app at a later stage.

[arriving at the information architecture]

We then started organising this based on how the users would be interacting with them. This is when
we started realising that some features seemed redundant while others were incomplete. We then
looked at how these various features would be impacted with respect to our user roles.
We looked at what are the requirements for a user to access our products as well as how the app
would be for users of any of the apps. Thus we were able to finalise the information architecture of the app.

## Concepts
Based on this information architecture, I created few app concepts which we evaluated before
finalising on the one we would present to the stakeholders. The final concept was presented as an
InVision prototype.

Notifications, Summary and Settings were concepts that we proposed as part of the new app.

**Notifications:**
At that point of time, we did not have a single in-product channel of communication. Most
communication happened either by emails, message bars or blocking dialogs. We wanted to change
this so we proposed a Notification Drawer. Further, we categorised as notifications as promotional and
transactional and provided users with a way to customise what kind of notifications they would like to
receive.

**Summary:**
The Summary section was conceived as the newsfeed that would be the landing page for returning
users to jump directly into their workflow. It was comprised of stationary widgets and a refreshing
infinite newsfeed. The widgets were devised only for transactional products like Ray and Consult. The
rest of the feed was to be powered by content from our other products like Healthfeed, Synapse and
Consult.

**Settings:**
Just like notifications, this did not exist but was an obvious thing to build. We didn't want the user to
experience the internal product separations that existed.
There were many many meetings and back and forth before we could get everyone to agree that this
was the way we should go ahead. During the final discussion with the stakeholders, It was decided
that the workflow based structure was too futuristic and we would need to have an interface that lets
our users understand our offerings. So we shifted to an app grid and widget landing as shown below
instead of a feed based landing.

## Detailing
I led this effort with a team of 3 other designers. Hetang, Akshay and me worked to create the various
product screens while Saloni was responsible for the theme and illustrations. Jonathan was overseeing
the entire operation and he gradually transitioned the responsibility to me.
We chose a clean content first approach that was becoming popular at that time. It was decided to
make the android and iOS apps similar in experience and independent of platforms. I set down the core
guidelines that we would need to follow to align the various parts of the products. We decided to use
the system fonts i.e., Roboto on Android and SF on iOS, when available, for the design. To finalise on
the elements, we mocked up key screens within the product to understand and added to our
guidelines when we found a component that was being used in multiple places.
[singularity stickersheet]

I created a stickersheet which functioned as a Master file for all the designers. We used a primitive
peer review process so that the various parts would be consistent and present a coherent experience.
Our core files would reside within Google Drive and we would work on our versions separately before I
would go through everyone’s files before replacing the versions in our core Drive folder.

## Final screens

During the implementation, I was the only designer assigned to the project and worked closely with the
developers to get things right which was how I earned the moniker ‘ceo’ from them. The android app
shipped on June 25th, 2016 to 100% while the iOS app took another month before it was ready for
release.


Thanks to Jonathan, Hetang, Akshay, Saloni and the rest of the Practo Partner team for coming
together to bring this once-in-a-lifetime project to life.
