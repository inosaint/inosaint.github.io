## Overview

Practo has around 100k doctor profiles and another 70k clinic profiles currently live on its marketplace.
This accounts for barely 50% of coverage in our T6 cities. So during the Q3-Q4 of 2016-17, the primary
objective of the unified app; Practo Partner, was to get more profiles published and live.

Around November 2016, to get a profile live on Practo.com, a doctor needed to fill in 20 fields which
were separated into 2 forms. We had taken the approach as an informational option but realized that
lot of profiles were not being completed and we did not communicate what was necessary to go live to
a doctor within the app.

## Understanding the problem

As seen above, we did communicate that a profile was incomplete but the interface didn't
communicate what was necessary for a doctor to go live. Our completion data showed us that major
dropoffs occurred during profile completion, proof upload and clinic profile addition.

We studied onboarding flows of other applications like Airbnb and Gyroscope which deal with filling lot
of mandatory data as well as Doximity which deals with the claiming of doctor profiles to get started.
Exploring a solution

After some discussions with the stakeholders, we decided the best way to deliver impact was if we
break this project into phases. For the first phase, we designed and shipped out with an intent page
and a quick fix stitching the two forms together. At the same time, the app was going through the new
brand implementation which explains the choice of color palette and the change in typography.

Post this change, we saw an increase(approx 34%) in the profiles going towards completion in the
month of March vs February and January numbers. This validated the brief and the direction that we
were going towards.

As part of the feet-on-street model adopted by Practo, we had several profiles that had been created
by the salesguy, however those profiles were not being used by the doctor and instead the doctor
would create a new profile when they logged in leading to duplicates which would be an overhead for
operations and decreased efficiency. We also needed doctors to keep their profile data fresh. So with
this in mind, Claim profile became a company objective so the next phase was integrating this into the
onboarding

The various usecases and catering to both new and existing users kept us busy for almost a month
where we iterated on various designs before narrowing down on one. We worked closely with the
profiles product team whenever we had to make a decision, since they knew best about the way profile
claim worked.


[early explorations]

Based on all these inputs, we were able to narrow down on the direction that we wanted to take for the
project.

### Things we are trying out with this
– The design accommodated for problems with the flow with keeping a way to access our hotline on all
the decision making pages.
– Users dropping off would be asked if they would want to be reminded to fill the form at a later time.
The form needs document proofs to be complete and these would not always be at hand.
