# TODO ðŸš§

Your new site is all yours so it doesn't matter if you break it! Try making an edit.

The site posts walk you through making some initial edits, adding a post, and tweaking the script.

## Keep going! ðŸš€

If you take another look in your site layout file for posts `src/_includes/layouts/post.njk` you'll see that the pages can include the post data from the frontmatter in the markdown files using Nunjucks templating. Each one of the posts includes a `description` property, so in `post.njk`, add that to the HTML template after the `h1`:

```
<p>
  <em>{{description}}</em>
</p>
```

Take a look at one of your posts to see the result!
